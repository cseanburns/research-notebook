[Curriculum Vitae](https://cseanburns.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cv)

I am an assistant professor at the [University of Kentucky][1]'s [School of
Library and Information Science][2]. My research interests include academic
libraries, scholarly communication, librarianship, library and information
science ethics and history, and research methods and methodologies. I'm
particularly interested in those phenomena that have substantial impact on
academic libraries and librarianship. For example, how do trends, behaviors,
practices, norms, and so forth impact academic libraries and librarians? I'm
currently working on a research project related to peer review and another
project related to the history of library science.

The motivation for this site is to keep a public log of my research notes
(at least anything that can be shared with the public, such as notes on
readings and some kinds of data collection). I do not consider any post a
final product and will make minor and major revisions to specific posts
after they have been pushed to the site. All revisions are hosted on
[GitHub][1], where past instances of a post or page may be viewed.

Old posts from a previous blogging platform but with this same domain were
transferred to
[http://cseanburns.blogspot.com/](http://cseanburns.blogspot.com/).

I am still considering whether I want to add a commenting system to this
site (e.g., disqus), and if so, which commenting system. In the meantime, if
you would like to respond to any of my posts, please feel free to email me
(sean.burns@uky.edu) or ping me on twitter at
[@burnscsb](https://twitter.com/burnscsb).

Note: I am fairly good about adding items I have read to my CiteULike
library. However, while I do not generally add items that are trivial,
adding an item to my library also does not mean I endorse its methods,
findings, conclusions, etc.
