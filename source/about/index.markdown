I am an assistant professor at the [University of
Kentucky](http://www.uky.edu)'s [School of Library and Information
Science](http://ci.uky.edu/lis/). My research interests include
academic libraries, scholarly communication, librarianship,
library and information science ethics and history, and research
methods and methodologies. I'm particularly interested in those
phenomena that have substantial impact on academic libraries and
librarianship. For example, how do trends, behaviors, practices,
norms, and so forth impact academic libraries and librarians?

The motivation for this site is to keep a public log of my
research notes. I don't consider any post a final product and will
make minor and major revisions to specific posts after they have
been pushed to the site. All revisions are hosted on [GitHub][1],
where past instances of a post or page may be viewed.
