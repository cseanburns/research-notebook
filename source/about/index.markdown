I am an assistant professor at the [University of
Kentucky](http://www.uky.edu)'s [School of Library and Information
Science](http://ci.uky.edu/lis/). My research interests include academic
libraries, scholarly communication, librarianship, library and
information science ethics and history, and research methods and
methodologies. 

This site will primarily be used to keep research notes -- thus its
title. The motivation is to keep a log. I do that already for my
research projects, but I haven't generally made them public.
