**Note:** The twenty-fourth article of the second issue of the

Hanson."

It was written by J. C. M. Hanson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** This is a very short, humorous half-page letter to J. C.
M. Hanson and appears to be from himself too. There is an
illegible signature at the end of the letter.
