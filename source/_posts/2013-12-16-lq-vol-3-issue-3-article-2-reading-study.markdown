**Note:** The second article of the third issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
library service in Great Britain: Effects of the
financial crisis."

It was written by J. M. Mitchell, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Carnegie United Kingdom Trust

**Note:** Simply put, an upbeat and short piece on the
advancements libraries were making despite the financial
hardships Britain was facing as a result of the Depression. 

My favorite line, I think:

> Those who attended the 1932 Annual Conference of the
> Library Association, held at Bournemouth under the
> presidency of Sir Henry Miers, could not fail to be
> impressed by the fact that the attendance was
> practically normal, and that, **with due allowance for
> the inevitable percentage of "web blankets," the
> spirit of the profession as a whole remained
> undaunted** \[emphasis added\] (p. 250).
