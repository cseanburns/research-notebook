**Note:** The ninth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The University of Chicago Libraries: A
Historical Note."

It was written by A. Th. Dorf, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Brooklyn, New York (No Affiliation)

**Note:** This article is a valuable history of both J. C. M.
Hanson's work at the University of Chicago Libraries but also of
the libraries themselves. Any future work on the history of
libraries should reference this article and its contents.

**Note:** Nice quote:

> It was one of Mr. Hanson's axioms that "there is no short-cut to
> anything, least of all in library science" ... (p. 196).

**Note:** Might be interesting to examine someday, as a thesis /
hypothesis:

> Nor did he hesitate to point out, which is customary honesty,
> that the larger the library the more costly the addition of each
> book. "Increasing perfection and completeness of the catalogs
> reduce expense, but growth will of itself increase it" (p. 196).

**Note:** Important historical note on Hanson's view of
librarianship:

> It remains to say a word about the development of a library
> staff. Mr. Hanson himself was an excellent, though a severe,
> teacher. His own standards were high, and he insisted that these
> standards be maintained by his staff. Some of this staff he
> brought with him from the Library of Congress; others he himself
> trained to the special needs of the university library. It was
> his firm conviction that the library science was an exacting
> one, and he insisted that assistants serve an apprenticeship
> before they were given positions of responsibility. The chief
> bibliographer, for example, was required to work for several
> years in the bookstacks and the classification department before
> he was given an opportunity to work in his special field (p.
> 196).

And:

> Mr. Hanson was particularly anxious to avoid, in library work,
> the narrow specialization that is characteristic of so much of
> American life. Foreign library journals and publications were
> distributed among the members of the staff who, in his opinion,
> had the maturity to profit by them, and they were given an
> opportunity to review these articles at the regular monthly
> meetings of the staff where the various problems of the library
> administration came up for discussion (p. 197).
