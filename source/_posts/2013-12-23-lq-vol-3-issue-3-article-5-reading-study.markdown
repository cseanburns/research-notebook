This entry is about:

Herbert, Clara W. (1933). Personnel requirements for
library branches in relation to circulation. *The
Library Quarterly, 3*(3), 292-304.

**Note:** The fifth article of the third issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Personnel Requirements for Library Branches in Relation
to Circulation."

It was written by Clara W. Herbert, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Public Library, District of Columbia

**Note:** Another article relating to personnel and to
standards (see also [Article 3 from this
issue][1]).

**Note:** Interesting quote from George Washington about
having too many students per instructor. See page 293.

**Note:** There is a very real desire to make the
evaluation of library work as non-subjective as
possible. The desire for objectivity is, it should be
noted, a desire for fairness. This article, for example,
at least begins in search of some mathematical way to
determine how many circulation personnel are needed at
any given library in order to maximize the benefit these
services offer to the community and to minimize the cost
to the taxpayers.

For example (and I can't get over this paragraph):

> Perhaps the following explanation will make Table I
> clearer. It will be noted that the unit of measurement
> was based on the smallest agency; for example under
> administration, if the square footage of the D branch
> is 2,211, the units for A, B, C branches will be there
> square footage divided by 2,211 or 3.4, 3.6, and 6.1,
> respectively. Again, if one unit is assigned to a
> staff of 4 persons, the units for a staff of 7 will be
> as many as 4 will go into 7 or 1.7; a staff of 12 will
> be as many as 4 goes into 12 or 3.0; and a staff of 22
> will be as many as 4 goes into 22 or 5.5. This
> procedure is followed throughout the table to give a
> picture of the relative demands of branches of
> different types. In translating the total units into
> time required, however, the standard of comparison was
> shifted to the B or Southeastern Branch because of its
> more typical aspects. All comparisons could have been
> made on the Southeastern Branch, but to avoid the use
> of decimals it was thought more convenient to compare
> the activities on the basis of the smallest branch. To
> complete the explanation: If the sum of the units
> representing the activities under "Administration" is
> 13.6 at the Southeastern Branch and it takes
> thirty-two hours weekly to perform them, it will take
> as many at the Mount Pleasant Branch as
> 13.6:32::23.6:x, or 56 hours (p. 296).

**Reflection:** Now refer to Kuhn and his discussion of
paradigms and rules. As much as Kuhn's discussion of
these topics applies to the social sciences, generally,
and to library science, specifically (and that's
doubtful), there is something to be said in that while
we may maintain the same paradigms as these 1930 library
researchers, our rules for expressing and rationalizing
these paradigms are much different today. In short, the
paragraph above is not the kind of paragraph, I think,
we'd see in present day literature.

**Note:** This article also follows the standard
structure (*LQ* articles are evolving): It's outline:

- Objectives (includes a literature review, so to speak)
- Procedure
- Results

Also has various subsections.

**Note:** The "factory" statement is good because I was
thinking that's what the author was trying to do:

> **Standards of achievement**.---Third, we wish to set
> up standards of achievement. We have no desire to turn
> the library into a factory or to place upon the staff
> strain additional to that inherent in public service.
> We felt, however, that reasonable standards based on
> figures of day-in and day-out work, not those
> obtained under the pressure of making a record, would
> be a satisfaction to the assistant and give us a sound
> position before economy boards. Accordingly, the
> following standards are before us tentatively. After
> experimentation they may require further revision (p.
> 302).

**Reflection:** Interestingly, this is the exact kind of
thing I desired to know when I was a cataloger. I wanted
some idea of how many books I was supposed to process
per hour.

**Note:** Just wondering what kind of mechanical devices
the author refers to:

> we are using forms and mechanical devices whenever
> possible ... (p. 303).
