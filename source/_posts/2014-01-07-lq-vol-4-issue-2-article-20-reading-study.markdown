**Note:** The twentieth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Library
Association Examinations."

It was written by John Minto, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Signet Library

**Note:** In short, this article highlights how extremely
challenging it would have been to become a librarian in the United
Kingdom in the early to mid-20th century. The examinations
required quite a bit of knowledge. Provides a short history of the
various library schools that came into existence during the first
few decades of the last century.

**Reflection:** While many of the articles in this *special* issue
are interesting, the issue itself is becoming rather tedious to
read through. Previous issues alway contained a good proportion of
stimulating material, but this issue seems stressed by the
apparent motivation to include a lot of material.
