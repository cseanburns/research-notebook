**Note:** The third article of the third issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Selecting applicants to a library school or training
class: An approach to a technique."

It was written by Charles K. A. Wang, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Kaifeng, China (No Affiliation)

**Note:** The study reported in this article is based on
personnel records. This could be interesting. Given the
reported location of the author, it's not yet clear if
the library system he refers to is one that is located
in the U.S. or in China.

**Note:** I believe this is the first article that most
closely resembles the modern structure of a "scientific"
article. It has a "procedure" section, a "results"
section, and a "discussion section."

**Note:** The amount of information libraries had on
their personnel is staggering:

> On the other hand, the library does have personnel
> records covering the graduates in its training class.
> Such records are of varying completeness and include
> application blanks, entrance-examination scores,
> library-training records, and intelligence scores (p.
> 253).

And:

> Up to the present, selection has been based in part on
> entrance examinations, school records, and, more
> recently, intelligence scores; but the number of
> qualified applicants so far exceeds vacancies in the
> training class that selection has rested largely on
> the subjective opinions of a few interviewers. This
> study undertakes to evaluate certain personality
> factors which by their presence or absence may
> contribute to one's success as a library assistant (p.
> 254).

**Note:** In the procedure section, the author uses
personnel records but also questionnaires. Plus! Two
personality tests. One that measures introversion and
extroversion and the other, which the author developed,
that measures "persistence." Plus!! An efficiency rating
was devised --- to measure how efficient a person was at
books or with people, and so could be placed in the
appropriate position. This is incredible.

**Note:** Interesting correlations throughout.

**Note:** Although it's not labeled, there's essentially
a section that discusses limitations. See the middle
paragraph on page 262.

**Note:** His suggestions:

> When these tests are given, the test scores are of
> selective value in themselves aside from the part they
> contribute to the total efficiency scores. In the case
> of the entrance examinations now in use, it is
> suggested that candidates be eliminated if their score
> is under 55. In the case of the intelligence test,
> candidates with scores of under 100 may be removed
> from further consideration. On the test of
> introversion-extroversion, it is probably safe to
> eliminate the extreme introverts, i.e., those with a
> score of +20 or more. With regard to the persistence
> scale, there is probably little to lose in eliminating
> candidates with a score below 60 (p. 263).

**Note:** Wow, the importance of being "objective":

> If, however, they are supplemented by intelligent
> observation on the part of the interviewer, such
> occasional errors might be avoided, although this
> subjective judgment is by no means encouraged (p.
> 263).
