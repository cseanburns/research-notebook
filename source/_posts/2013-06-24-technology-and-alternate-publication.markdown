Notes on Farkas-Conn's [From Documentation to Information
Science][1], chapter 3.

_Old themes, old promises_:

The returning question: are there technological solutions to
various problems in scholarly communication? In the 1930s, Davis
thought that microfilm technology would "'unlock the written
literature'" and "break the log jam of scholarly publications" (p.
48). There's no doubt that technology, then and now, has unlocked
the written literature and much more, but has it broken the log
jam? Hardly. That log jam is the result of various other issues --
few of which have anything to do with scholarly communication or
with technology -- and more to do with social, economic, and
pyschological factors.

> In the summer of 1935, Davis explored the concept of publishing
> scientific journals on microfilm with Thomas Midgley, Jr.,
> chairman of the board of the American Chemical Society (ACS).
> The idea appealed to Midgley. He had been disturbed that journal
> editors were bringing "pressure on authors for brevity" to
> reduce publication costs, allowing less and less space for
> theorizing and speculation, which, in turn, would bring about
> the stagnation of science. He thought that a periodical such as
> the *Journal of Physical Chemistry* published on microfilm could
> provide an arena for specialists to exchange "speculative
> thought" (pp. 44 - 45).

The above passage indicates an additional, important note on why
bibliometricians and others often look at article length, or why
it should be examined under certain types of inquiries.

Relevance to today: the role that non-standard formal and informal
scholarly publication formats and media (e.g., blogs, data
repositories, institutional / subject repositories, etc.) can
play. In a sense, these passages provide historic warrant for
other outlets.

_Auxiliary Publication Service_:

The service "was a central depository of manuscripts that were too
voluminous, highly specialized, 'or not of sufficient general
interest ... to be published under existing publishing conditions"
(p. 49).

_Reception by journal editors_:

> Science editors liked the idea: some were enthusiastic. Within a
> few months after the service was started, forty-three editors
> indicated their willingness to cooperate with auxiliary
> publications. *Chemical Abstracts* was the first abstracting
> service to participate (p. 49). 

On the other hand, since the auxiliary service was not meant to
provide material that would be widely read (unlike some of the
examples mentioned above), perhaps the historical warrant needs
further inquiry:

> In his [Davis] view, careful editing was justified for journals
> of large circulation serving many readers, but the highly
> technical and detailed material likely to be submitted for
> auxiliary publication would be read by very few people and thus
> did not warrant rigorous editing or even perfect typing" (p.
> 50).

In fact, the above passage indicates that the auxiliary service is
wholly unlike today's alternative, informal modes of publication
--- because some of these modes (e.g., blogs) have the probability
of being highly disseminated and read because of their
accessibility. The question then, as Davis was concerned with (see
next paragraph after above quoted passage), is what *validity* do
alternate modes of publication have in the scientific community?
*Only* if the scientific community assumes them to be valid,
should they be measured with respect to that scientific
community's values. Otherwise, they may be measured for other
reasons, e.g., the dissemination of scientific findings to the
public.

Note: a test for scientific validity in the *altmetrics* community
seems to be based on the dissemination, as can be measured, of a
piece of work and not strictly on the value the scientific
community places on the work, as assessed and regulated in the
usual manners. It is yet clear how dissemination is a measure of
scientific validity (here I'm reminded of work related to impact
that is negative, e.g., Nicolaisen's [The J-Shaped Distribution of
Citedness][2]). This identifies the *altmetric* assumption: that
worth is based on dissemination. Here library and information
science (and not one or the other but both jointly), with respect
to their role in the knowledge of dissemination, have played
important roles in identifying the things (variables, qualities)
that hinder dissemination. But the identification of those
*things* has served a purpose -- to promote dissemination in
regulated ways. An important question: does (or has) regulating
the description of information maximize its dissemination?
