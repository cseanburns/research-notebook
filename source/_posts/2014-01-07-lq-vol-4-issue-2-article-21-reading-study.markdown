**Note:** The twenty-first article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "National Departments in Scandinavian."

It was written by Wilhelm Munthe, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Universitetsbiblioteket


**Note:** A very respectful response to a critique written by J.
C. M. Hanson on the Norwegian:

> practice of dividing the books in national libraries into two
> main divisions, one to hold the books printed or published in
> the country itself and the second to include all foreign books
> (p. 296).
