**Note:** The twenty-sixth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Mr. Hanson and
His Friends."

It was written by Helen K. Starr, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** James J. Hill Reference Library

**Note:** This is a really sweet piece that describes some of the
personalities of the librarians who worked in the cataloging
division of the Library of Congress when J. C. M. Hanson headed
the division. The piece is like a gold mine of biographical
insight.
