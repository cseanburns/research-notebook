**Note:** The sixth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Author Entries for
Canadian Government Publications."

It was written by James B. Childs, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Library of Congress

**Note:** Begins with a brief history of Canada and then lists the
names to use as author entries for various Canadian government
organizations, departments, boards. I have no idea why this is in
*LQ*. It could be very appropriate for the journal, but the author
does not provide much of any reasoning. Not sure why this is an
issue dedicated to Hanson, either.
