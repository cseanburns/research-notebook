**Note:** The second article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Our
Libraries: The Trend toward Democracy."

It was written by J. Periam Danton, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** The Depression is really becoming evident in
these articles now.

**Note:** The previous article hinted at the same idea:

> The very fact that an institution is forced to
> retrench may bring to light possible economies or
> improvements in efficiency or service which would not
> otherwise have been noticed (p. 16).

**Note:** Examining not just libraries but democracy
itself:

> It is by way of being platitudinous to say that the
> country and age in which we live are constitutionally
> democratic, but it may be valuable to recall and
> examine the assumption from time to time, particularly
> with regard to certain aspects of institution control
> and management as these are currently practiced (p.
> 16).

**Note:** Interesting turn. This article is about the
management of libraries and how democratic their
practices are. First the author writes about book
selection and incorporating the entire staff, next the
author writes about composing annual reports, and then
the author provides other examples. This would make an
good, historical article for a library admin /
management course.

**Note:** True today?

> Corporate wealth has given up within the past twelve
> months more power than in any previous decade; labor
> now meets the representatives of government, industry,
> and the public on equal terms, and the voice of the
> employee, speaking through the new trade codes, has
> more authority and receives more attention than at
> almost any time in our history since the earliest
> colonial days (p. 19).

**Note:** The above is followed with remarks on the
administration and organization of universities.
Important higher education comments here.

**Note:** On the evolution of librarianship:

> To be sure, the librarians-collector, the
> librarians-bibliographer, and the librarians-scholar
> of an older day have largely given place to, or been
> combined with, the librarian-organizer and executive
> of today (p. 24).

**Note:** Ends with some provoking questions:

> In short, is not the change from the present fairly
> autocratic administration of libraries to a more or
> less completely active, participating, democratic one
> an almost inevitable change to which we ought and must
> look forward, a change which should be aided in every
> way, and one for which librarians should prepare and
> be prepared (p. 27)?

**Note:** J. Periam Danton was a very interesting person. More
about him and his work at Berkeley here:
[http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/JosephPeriamDanton.htm](http://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/inmemoriam/JosephPeriamDanton.htm).
E.g., while this is his first *LQ* article, his last one was
published in *LQ* 65 years later, in 1999.
