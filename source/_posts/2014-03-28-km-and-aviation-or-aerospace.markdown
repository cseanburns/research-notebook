**Preface:**

This semester I am teaching a knowledge management (KM) course. I
will be posting entries throughout the semester that describe,
critique, summarize, outline, etc. KM articles that my students
are not reading. The purpose here is to leverage the amount of
material I can expose them to.

**Article under discussion:**

This post is about:

Harvey, D. J., &amp; Holdsworth, R. (2005). Knowledge management
in the aerospace industry. *Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE
International Professional Communication Conference*, 237-243.
doi:[10.1109/IPCC.2005.1494182](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPCC.2005.1494182)

The article was picked after searching for the term **knowledge
management** in [CiteULike](http://www.citeulike.org/) and
browsing the results.

**Notes and discussion:**

The article begins by stressing not only the size of the aerospace
industry, which includes both civilian and military aspects, but
also the diversity of its workforce and the diversity of the
companies that support the industry. Furthermore, the safety and
the economics of the industry are both significant to lives and
sensitive to minor fluctuations. Managing knowledge in such a
context is not just an organizational problem, it is an
industry-wide problem.

Nice passage on the expectation of KM:

> In essence, like any other industry, the aerospace industry
> expects that any knowledge management initiatives will produce
> cheaper products more quickly without compromising product or
> personnel safety while maintaining an acceptable level of
> business risk (p. 238).

Issues that are barriers to effective knowledge management systems
and practices:

- compliance with regulations
- safety concerns
- merging "process rigor" (p. 238) with KM in order to create
  flexibility
- insuring information is not lost (keeping tacit knowledge)
- issues of reporting errors, disclosure, and trust in the
  industry; "information context" (p. 238). Good quote:

> It is about information context and optimisation of information
> to maximize knowledge where and when it is required. Providing
> people (e.g., the flying public) with information that they do
> not need, cannot understand, or may misinterpret is equally as
> bad as not providing information that they do need; it does not
> increase "real" knowledge (pp. 238-239).

- issues with competency and with authority; the problem of
  "equating information with knowledge" (p. 239)

One key need here, the authors argue, is that knowledge management
should help make regulation more effective. The issue here is with
decision making, characteristics and contexts of information,
access to the right information and excluding the irrelevant,
increase flexibility, foster knowledge sharing, wisdom, and
storage.

Part of the problem:

> For large aerospace companies, the problem is not so much the
> technologies, but the logistics and costs involved in
> implementation of the technologies and knowledge management
> processes (p. 240).

The authors discuss issues related to intellectual property (with
respect to commercial industry) and to classified information
(with respect to government and military agencies). A number of
other complex issues are discussed --- issues that highlight the
unique knowledge management challenges that face the aerospace
industry.

Under the section of **People Issues**, a good quote about
communication:

> Particularly in defence aerospace, there are large costs
> involved in just making collaboration and communication possible
> (p. 241).

The above leads to a question that can be asked of other areas in
general: what's the cost of collaboration? what's the cost of not
collaborating?

The authors raise a point about issues of organizational
structure, such that payment and terms of employment are generally
linked not to one's level of knowledge or skill but to one's level
of "accountability and responsibility" (p. 241).

There are cultural implications in the above hierarchy, the
authors essentially stress. Management rank themselves by, for
example, their budgets and staff size. Scientists and engineers,
however, rank themselves by what they know. This would create
organizational tensions.

Overall, a nice article that provides additional context about KM
issues.
