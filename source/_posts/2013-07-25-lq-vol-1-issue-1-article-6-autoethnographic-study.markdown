**Preface:**

This post is part of a series of field notes on an
autoethnographic reading of [*The Library
Quarterly*](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/lq.html).
The collection can be accessed by visiting the following link:

For an explanation of the project, see:

**Reading and Posting Guide:**

My comments, writings, etc. begin with the term **Note**. Each new
thought begins with that term. Follow up paragraphs, if any, will
not.

My reflections will begin with the term **Reflection**. These may
usually be posted toward the end of the post, but may also be
interspersed throughout the document. I'll see how it goes.

If I am quoting a term, I may quote it within a **Note**, that is,
within my text. If I am quoting a phrase, a sentence, or something
longer, I will quote it as a block quote.

All quotes are assumed to be by the author of the paper under
investigation. If I quote another source, I will add the author's
name, year, and page number after that quote: e.g., (Author, Year,
p. n).

Because these are notes, they are not heavily edited for grammar.

This entry is about:

Reeves, Floyd W., &amp; Russell, John Dale. (1931). The Relation
of the College Library to Recent Movements in Higher Education.
*The Library Quarterly, 1*(1), 57-66.

**Note:** The sixth article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "The Relation of the College Library to Recent Movements
in Higher Education." It was co-authored by Floyd W. Reeves and
John Dale Russell, who were both affiliated with the University of
Chicago.

**Note:** Another source confirming [Shiflett][1] and [Hamlin][2].

> It is only in comparatively recent decades that the maintenance
> of a library has been recognized as a necessary function of a
> college (p. 57).

The rest of the paragraph provides a nice description.

[2]: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7276988

And it was a problem even up to the time of writing, or near to
it:

> Although the stronger and better-administered colleges began
> early to develop systematic plans for increasing the
> effectiveness of their libraries, the condition which has been
> described persisted in most of the weaker institutions until
> well into the twentieth century (p. 57).

**Note:** The next paragraph details some of the reasons why
colleges began building up their libraries: standardizing
associations and state departments of education, namely.

**Note:** The next paragraph details why they didn't build up
their libraries before. Namely:

> The principal reason for this lack of interest in the library is
> probably attributable to the "lesson-hearing" and textbook type
> of instruction which as prevailed in colleges. Under such
> instructional methods little use is made of the library. The
> instructor merely assigns "so many pages in the text for next
> time," and when the class meets again the hour is devoted to
> hearing a recitation on the assigned materials in the text" (p.
> 58).

Regarding the above quote, frame this problem today with respect
to undergraduates' use of the library (and their use of
textbooks), graduates' use of the library (and their use of
textbooks). The correlation is probably strong and negative, even
today.

**Note:** As with the above quote, not much sometimes changes:

> In fact, under the "textbook" plan of instruction, a library
> assignment is looked upon by students as something of a bore, as
> just another chore to be performed for an overconscientious
> instructor (p. 59).

**Note:** The authors suggest that changes in higher education
trends will impact library development in certain ways. First:

> The first educational movement which affects the library is the
> rapid increase which has occurred in the amount of course work
> carried in the field of the social sciences (p. 59).

The authors go on to say that a decline or a leveling of courses
in foreign languages and mathematics, both of which tend to not
need the use of the library, and an increase in social studies
courses, which require more library reading, as well as student
bodies, will involve more use of the library.

Also, social studies / social sciences are fields where,

> new material is being produced at a comparatively rapid rate (p.
> 60).

**Note**: Second:

> A second educational movement affecting library conditions in
> the college is the introduction of general survey courses (p.
> 60).

Although since survey courses are now well established, this is
probably not true today:

> It is the observation of the writers that these survey courses
> do not function satisfactorily where given by the textbook
> method (p. 61).

Although, I mean "probably not true today" in certain way. It may
be true that textbooks do not do well for survey courses, but
anthologies, functioning in the same way as textbooks, might. And
the use of anthologies might deter library use now. So, I'm just
generalizing from textbooks to anything that students have to buy
that diminishes their need to use the library.

**Note:** Third:

> A third educational movement which will have an effect upon the
> library is the change in the methods of science teaching (p.
> 61).

Basically the authors argue that science teaching is becoming less
dependent on laboratory work, at least in the early years of
higher education, and more dependent on lectures and outside
reading.

**Note:** Fourth:

> Within the last few years a large number of the better colleges
> of the country have introduced independent work courses,
> sometimes referred to as "honors" work (p. 62).

Of note about this: this trend would not only require more library
material but it would also require, the authors note, a need for
reference librarians who can help the independent students find
relevant work related to their independent studies.

**Note:** Fifth:

> Some colleges and universities are experimenting with the
> introduction of a course of general reading. Such a course cuts
> straight across departmental lines, in an attempt to give
> students a broad and general view of the classic expressions of
> human thought in all fields (p. 62).

The authors note, that in response to this trend, not only is more
material needed in the library, but the library has responded by
setting up reading or seminar rooms. This was another important
point in [Shiflett][1] and [Hamlin][2].

**Note**: Sixth:

> Another educational movement affecting the library is the
> breaking-down of the hard-and-fast barriers which have separated
> the various fields of study into departments, and the provision
> for a much greater degree of correlation of subject matter in
> related fields (p. 63).

This trend died a long time ago. Instead of majors and minors,
some colleges were using fields of concentration, usually four to
eight of them. Nice idea.

**Note**: Seventh:

> Another educational movement which will affect the college
> library is the development of graduate study (p. 63).

**Note**: The authors then list the kinds of demands these seven
movements will have on the college library.

- larger book collection (p. 64)
- "care in the selection of library materials" (p. 65)

> An attempt to extend the book collection rapidly usually
> overtaxes the ability of faculty members to select books (p.
> 65).

Also in agreement with Shiflett, Hamlin, and others. Academic
librarians didn't begin collection development, in the whole,
until the 1940s.

Back to our list:

- "larger facilities for study by students" (p. 65)
- "better trained library staff" (p. 65), including for selection
  of books and for the need of good reference librarians
- "direct instruction in the techniques of bibliography" (p. 65).
  What we today call *information literacy instruction*. There's
  been the occasional problem, I've noticed, that information
  literacy efforts are new when they're actually, as this article
  proves, over eight decades old.
- self-evalation or "continuous self-survey" (p. 66) (that is, of
  the library)

An important final quote, and perhaps one of the original uses of
the *library as center of the academy* theme:

> The college library of the future, if it is to serve adequately
> the needs of the institution, must become the center of academic
> activities (p. 66).

**Reflection**: This is an important historical piece. I'll come
back to it.
