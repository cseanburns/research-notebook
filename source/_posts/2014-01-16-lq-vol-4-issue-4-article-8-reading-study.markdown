**Note:** The eighth article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Graduate Theses
Accepted by Library Schools in the United States during the
Academic Year 1932-1933."

It was written Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** This a continuation of this article:

[Waples,
1933](/blog/2013/12/23/lq-vol-3-issue-3-article-4-reading-study/)

**Note:** The article is a simple bibliography. The introduction
mentions the previous year's article and then introduces this one.
Waples writes:

> Thirty-six graduate theses were accepted this year by four
> schools, namely: California, seven; Chicago, two; Columbia,
> thirteen; and Illinois, fourteen.

Waples then distributes the theses under the thirteen headings he
created in the previous article. It's an interesting mix. Three
of his subject headings are dedicated to some facet of
bibliography:

- enumerative bibliography
- descriptive bibliography
- critical bibliography

*Reflection:*  I really would like to look at a lot these theses
some day.
