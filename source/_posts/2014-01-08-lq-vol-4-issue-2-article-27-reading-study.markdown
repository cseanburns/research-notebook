**Note:** The twenty-seventh article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Who Was J. L.
S.\*\*?"

It was written by Leonhard Stejneger, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** United States National Museum

**Note:** Authorial detective work. The content deals with a
history that I am woefully ignorant, but I greatly admire the
ability to fashion a narrative concerning tracing the identity of
a work.
