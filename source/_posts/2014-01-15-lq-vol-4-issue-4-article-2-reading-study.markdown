**Note:** The second article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Bibliotheca Corvina."

It was written by Géza Schütz, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Montclair Free Public Library

**Note:** Nice history of the [Bibliotheca Corvina][1] library.

**Note:** I wonder if any economic historians have examined the
economics of early printing. I find this statement relevant to
today:

> unemployment was provoked there by the manufacture and the sale
> of printed books (p. 559).
