**Note:** The fourth article of the second issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "A
royal book-collector."

It was written by Guy R. Lyle, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Antioch College

**Note:** A brief history of King George III's pursuit
of a royal library, which eventually, through his son,
was bequeathed to the British Museum. The article is
highly favorable of the King, and the story reminds me
of Thomas Jefferson's role with the Library of Congress,
although only superficially analogous.

There's an interesting and rather delightful story about
an exchange between Dr. Samuel Johnson and the King.
It's entirely quoted. Much of this article is quotes,
though.
