This entry is about:

**Note:** The second article of the fourth issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "To What Extend Do the Students of the
Liberal-Arts Colleges Use the Bibliographic Items Given on the
Catalogue Card?"

It was written by Susan Grey Akers, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of North Carolina

**Note:** It's long been about service and users:

> The implication of the foregoing quotation is that in order to
> make a good catalogue it is necessary to know the needs of the
> users of that catalogue [...] (p. 394).

The "foregoing quotation" is from the following source (quoted
from the first endnote on page 394 of this article):

> W. M. Randall, "The Uses of library catalogs," *Catalogers' and
> classifiers' yearbook, II (1930), 26-27.

Since the above comment and quote are so interesting, given the
time, I just did a quick search for W. M. Randall's article and I
came across a piece I remember reading quite a while ago:

Connaway, Lynn S., Johnson, Debra W., &amp; Searing, Susan E.
(1997). [Online Catalogs from the Users' Perspective: The Use of
Focus Group
Interviews](http://crl.acrl.org/content/58/5/403.abstract).
*College &amp; Research Libraries, 58*(5), 403-420.

In the Connaway, Johnson, and Searing article, they write:

> The origin of catalog use studies is credited to a 1930 paper
> written by William M. Randall. Randall contended that catalogs
> cannot be improved by studying catalog rules or the catalogs
> themselves but, rather, by studying catalog users needs,
> backgrounds, and mental capabilities (p. 404).

**Note:** This is a really interesting piece. The author is
describing the use of pilot studies, collecting data by
interviewing students or asking the students to maintain diaries.
The decided way to collect data involved students completing
checklists about their interaction with the catalog.

Two hundred and fifty-seven students completed checklists.

**Note:** Akers suggests that her study should be generalizable to
all liberal arts college students. How she tests this is really
interesting:

> The reliability of these students as a sample of the students in
> liberal-arts colleges was tested by correlating the votes of
> one-half the students from each college with the votes of the
> other half of the students from each college in order to see if
> the group was homogeneous (p. 397).

**Note:** The research involved asking students what part of the
card they used. Akers then ranked the results. One finding, for
example, is that students ranked the **Date of book** information
as the most important information on the card, and the **Series
notes for all series** information as the least important (see
Table II, p. 399).

**Note:** Akers now reports student comments. I like this one:

> 2\. I should like to see a card system arranged so that an
> average individual not having been in the library before could
> find a book .... **without having to bother the librarian for
> the required information**. As for the cards, I do not believe
> that the thousand-and-one abbreviations used can be understood
> by anyone but a librarian. Why not simplify the entire system?
> It can be done \[emphasis added\] (p. 405).

Emphasis added because it just shows that students have never
wanted to go to the librarian. This is a universal law!

**Reflection:** UNIVERSAL LAW OF LIBRARIES I: Students dislike
requesting assistance from librarians.

**Note:** More wish list for the card catalog:

> 11\. I should like to suggest that in the case of books of
> reference the position of the author be stated so that one might
> infer what authority the book carries if one is not acquainted
> with the author (p. 406).

**Note:** All librarians will nod their heads at this request:

> 34\. Color of the book (p. 407).

**Reflection:** A really interesting piece--background, methods,
data collection, findings, conclusion (not described here). The
article involved a very short literature review because there was
only one article on the topic before this one (the Randall piece,
see above).
