**Note:** The third article of the fourth issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "State Provisions for
the Support of Municipal Public Libraries and Some Comparisons
with State Provisions for the Support of Public Schools."

It was written by Lee Wachtel, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** Another article that deals with some aspect of public
education and public libraries. Previous articles (based on a
quick search) that I've noted include:

- Joeckel and ["The Public Library under the City-Manager Form of
  Goverment"][1]
- Lewerenz and ["Children and the Public Library"][2]
- Borden and ["The Sociological Beginnings of the Library
  Movement"][3]
- Joeckel and ["The Public Library under the City-Manager Form of
  Government (Continued)"][4]
- Leland and ["Observations on Financing Libraries"][5]

**Note:** Historical note:

> Whereas almost every state has some provision in its
> constitution for the establishment and maintenance of the public
> school, only one state, Michigan, provides in any way at all for
> the public library (p. 373).

More:

> Notwithstanding this, the establishment and support of the
> public library is still considered to be a local function, and
> not an obligation of the state. This is quite evident from the
> legislative enactments. In no case is library legislation
> compulsory as is school legislation (p. 375).

**Note:** Good article for anyone interested in public library
funding --- especially the history of it.

**Note:** There is a lot of good and detailed information in this
article, but here's one of the author's main points:

> As has been indicated above, the most significant difference
> between school legislation and library legislation is that the
> one is compulsory and the other permissive, though the general
> property tax is the main source of revenue for both these
> services (p. 386).

More:

> The library receives little state aid because it is still
> conceived of as a local function (p. 386).

**Note:** Another historical note / observation:

> The county library system as developed in California and other
> states is a serious attempt to avoid wastefulness and
> duplication in basic library collections, buildings, equipment,
> catalogues, et al., in communities which are sufficiently close
> to one another to receive library service from a common source.
> It would, however, be premature and perhaps inaccurate to infer
> that the county is the ideal unit for purposes of library
> organization (p. 387).

The rest of the paragraph contains important points about
determining library unit sizes, scopes, reach, etc. based on
empirical data rather than on politic divisions.

**Note:** So, like [Shera][6], the author makes note of the
increasing centralization of government. This would have been on
the public's mind at the time (given President Roosevelt's efforts
at the time to combat the Depression):

[6]: /blog/2013/12/30/lq-vol-3-issue-4-article-1-reading-study/

> The problem of determining the proper unit for library
> organization and support is bound up with the larger problem of
> governmental consolidation and centralization. The movement
> toward consolidation is close at hand, and it is a question
> whether independent library boards and library districts will
> remain unaffected (p. 387).

The above line suggests the need to understand more about the
relationship between the Depression, federal government efforts to
combat it, and the rise of public libraries. This would be the
kind of research project very much in line with what many of these
early *LQ* authors are trying to push (sociological, economical,
political lines of inquiry).

**Note:** Important comment on the relationship between libraries
and government:

> The second assumption results from a hazy conception of the
> place of the library in the government structure. State
> provisions for library support assume that public libraries
> should have little or no relation to other governmental
> agencies. The bogey of "politics" and the battle-cry, "Keep
> politics out of the library," have resulted in the establishment
> of independent boards with segregated funds and separate powers.
> But here also the forces of centralization are at work, and
> there is a tendency to modify the position of independent
> boards. This tendency is especially noticeable in city manager
> cities where the librarian is made directly responsible to the
> city manager, and the library board is either entirely dispensed
> with or given advisory power only. Students of political science
> have contended that independent boards with segregated funds and
> separate powers are harmful; that they complicate governmental
> machinery by adding additional units to it; and that they hinder
> the development of sound budgetary and fiscal practices (p.
> 388).
