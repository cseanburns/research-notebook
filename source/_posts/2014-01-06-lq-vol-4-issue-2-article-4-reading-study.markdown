**Note:** The fourth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Women Not
Considered Human Beings: A Bibliological Curiosity."

It was written by J. Christian Bay, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** John Crerar Library

**Note:** The author quotes from a quarto that was
written in Latin. Does not translate and assumes that
the reader will be able to translate.

**Note:** Very progressive (for the time):

> The thesis that woman is of an inferior clay and
> therefore socially and legally negligible, was
> exploded long ago. Women now function in all
> professions, indeed even as librarians, and excel
> beyond measure in physical, political, and academic
> competition with man everywhere, some nearly
> abrogating their cultural state (p. 156).

**Note:** This is largely a bibliology. Not sure why the
author is arguing against the above premise (he does so
as if the premise is current and he is attempting to
discount it).
