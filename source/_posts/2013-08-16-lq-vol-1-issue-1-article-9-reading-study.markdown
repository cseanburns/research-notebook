**Note:** The ninth and last article published in the first issue
of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "What Can the Foreigner Find
to Read in the Public Library?" It was written by William M.
Randall, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** This is a nice read. Here's a point by the author that
reflects the sentiment of the piece:

> There is no consistent relationship between the number of books
> per capita and the circulation per book.... Two possibilites,
> therefore, present themselves. Either some nationalities read
> more than others, or the books in certain libraries are better
> chosen than those in others.  
>
> The latter seems more probable (p. 87).

**Note:** This article makes me want to time travel back to 1931
and get a faculty job at the Graduate Library School. Lots of
humor in the writing.

**Note:** In seriousness, this is a really wonderful article. I
would have expected it to be less enlightened about foreign
language material, but it's probably much more enlightened than
many present day policies are. It ends with some good
questions---both about the purpose of the public library and about
how to carry out additional research. It's another possible
reading item for a collection management class (at least suggested
reading item).
