**Note:** The first article of the third issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
Invention of Printing and Its Spread till 1470: With
Special Reference to Social and Economic Factors."

It was written by B. A. Uhlendorf, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan

**Note:** On research in early printing, its relation to
"scientific investigation" and on "connecting it to
other fields of human knowledge":

> When one reviews the literature on early printing,
> which, since about 1900, has been a field of thorough
> scientific investigation, one cannot but realize that
> the time has come when the student of incunabula must
> enliven the product of his labors by relating it to
> other fields of human knowledge (p. 179).

Uhlendorf claims that the "spiritual awakening* that
took hold of Europe before the invention of the printing
press was a necessary condition for the invention of the
printing press.

And the rise of the city, in medieval society, was also
a necessary condition. The exchange of goods and
services enabled the exchange of print.

And the rise of the gild system in the city.

And the importance of the merchant at this time:

> He \[the merchant\] provided himself with the new
> works at the spring and fall fairs, and thus
> contributed his share toward the promulgation of ideas
> (p. 182).

**Note:** As today (i.e., the web), the importance of
"youth" to the rise and acceptance of printing:

> The spirit of the German universities, if indeed their
> superannuated scholasticism can be called "spirit,"
> was lifeless, pedantic, factional, and it was youth
> which revolted against ossification in its attempt to
> open the gates of the universities to the new ideas,
> which many of them had imbibed during years of study
> at Italian universities (pp. 185-186).

**Note:** After describing the method of instruction
given by professors at the time (they spoke mostly from
memory) and the limited availability of poor copies of
their lectures:

> We feel that the great need for mechanical
> reproduction of manuscripts was not so much an
> economic necessity as it was a dire need for
> more---and, above all, for more correct---texts (p.
> 187).

**Note:** This is relevant today, as an important
function of printing and the disruption of the web:

> Indeed, the Chinese word for a print and for a seal is
> one and the same: it implies authentication (p. 187).

**Note:** The author notes the importance of Chinese
experimentation with printing, preceding Gutenberg 400
years, and paper-making.

**Note:** This is interesting: print as a new type face
or print as mimicry of handwriting:

> While for Gutenberg it was an essential principle to
> reproduce handwriting with great accuracy, even to
> imperfect line-endings, Schoeffer abandoned this
> practice and did the best with the material he had.
> Comparing, for example, his **Durandus** with
> Gutenberg's **Catholicon**, one cannot but see that,
> while to Schoeffer the letter was more or less a unit
> which merely contributed toward forming a word,
> Gutenberg, like a copyist, must have considered for
> his unit the word, using all sorts of tied letters and
> frequently resorting to the file (p. 195).

**Note:** On Peter Schoeffer:

> Besides introducing into printing the practice of
> using colophons, Schoeffer was the first to use more
> than one size of font of type in one book (p. 195).

**Reflection:** I keep wondering, who is Uhlendorf's
audience? Is it librarians? Is it library science
scholars? An interesting project would involve tracing
this.

**Note:** More on Schoeffer and his contribution to
printing:

> Schoeffer, on the other hand, gradually freed printing
> from too slavish copying of manuscript books. He
> introduced almost perfect line-endings, which,
> however, was also striven for by Pfister in his later
> works, even if he had to divide a word in quite a
> ludicrous manner (p. 198).

**Note:** This seems important in regards to the
universalizing (for lack of a better word at the moment) of
print. That is, what we have here could be at least an early
kind of Copernican Revolution, in the sense that the
standardization of font and typeface away from the
idiosyncrasies of personal handwriting functioned to
de-personalize the author -- to make less provincial.
Furthermore, perhaps there is a relation here between the
de-personalization of the author with respect to print and
Merton's *universalism* norm with regards to the function of a
scientist --- it's not the scientist that is important, it is the
science; it's not the author that is important, it's the
content. And for that content to be disseminated, it could not be
provincial or too personal or suffer from local "archetypes."

> While Gutenberg cut his types on local manuscript
> models and imitated manuscripts even in the
> composition of the page, and while later printers cut
> their own type after the style of writing of their
> region, perhaps even after the book hand of the
> particular manuscript to be copied, it is only natural
> that they should soon find out that it was much easier
> to design new type after printing books. Moreover,
> when the local market was well supplied and the sale
> of books began to depend upon more distant localities,
> they probably found it necessary to use fonts that
> were not of too local a character. In other words, the
> number of archetypes (**Urtypen**), as Haebler calls
> them, became less and less (p. 212).

**Note:** On the beginnings of publishing houses:

> Again very early there prevails a certain commercial aspect; the
> **business** of printing became associated with the **art** of
> printing. A master printer perhaps hired helpers on
> short-term contracts, or even for the printing of a certain
> book only; printers banded together to form organizations;
> scholars either made financial arrangements with printers for
> the publication of one or several works, or hired some
> artisan, financed the establishment of a shop, and legally
> assured themselves of a certain percentage of the earnings---in
> short, we have the beginning of the publishing business (p.
> 225).

**Note:** More on the universalism:

> While the German printers tenaciously held to their
> local type faces, the typographers of Italy,
> especially those of Venice, created characters which
> could be adopted universally, for, indeed, they had to
> count upon the sale of their works in all parts of
> Europe (p. 229).
