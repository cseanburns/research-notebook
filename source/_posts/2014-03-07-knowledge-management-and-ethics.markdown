**Preface:**

This semester I am teaching a knowledge management (KM) course. I
will be posting entries throughout the semester that describe,
critique, summarize, outline, etc. KM articles that my students
are not reading. The purpose here is to leverage the amount of
material I can expose them to.

**Article under discussion:**

This post is about:

Chatterjee, Sutirtha &amp; Sarker, Suprateek. (2013). Infusing
ethical considerations in knowledge management scholarship: Toward
a research agenda. *Journal of the Association for Information
Systems, 14*(8), 452-481. Available via EbscoHost at UK Libraries.

The article was picked after a browsing a number of databases,
using various search terms related to knowledge management and
ethics. The databases include:

* Library and Information Science and Technology Abstracts (LISTA)
* [BASE: Bielefeld Academic Search Engine](http://www.base-search.net/)
* [ROAR: Registry of Open Access Repositories](http://roar.eprints.org/content.html)
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/)

**Notes and discussion:**

The article begins by noting that,

> the study of KM is an inherently socio-technical enterprise---at
> the confluence of human beings and technology (p. 453).

And,

> given the observation that ethical considerations are paramount
> in any socio-technical system, we believe that ethical
> considerations can be fruitful in furthering KM research in the
> IS discipline (p. 453).

The authors highlight ethical and knowledge management research is
rare.

The authors discuss three motivations for this research. The
discussions are thorough for such short review sections and well
worth a read. The motivations are, with rewording to lesser and
greater degrees:

1. There is a relationship between ethics and knowledge (see
   section beginning p. 454).
1. KM activities (knowledge creation, transfer, storage,
   retrieval, etc.) reveal a number of ethical issues (see section
   beginning on page 456).
1. There is little prior research on ethics and KM (see section
   beginning on page 457).

The authors then begin to review philosophical theories of ethics.
This includes "consequentialist ethics [utilitarian],
deontological ethics, and virtue ethics" (p. 457). Then the
authors show how each theory could be used to extend ethical
research in the KM field. Table 3 on p. 462 provides an excellent
blueprint for such a pursuit. For example, if:

The activity under examination is **knowledge creation**, and the
ethical perspective under consideration is **consequentialist
ethics**, then a possible research question is:

> What are the effects of knowledge creation on organizational
> positive orientations (p. 462).

Or, if the activity under examination is **knowledge transfer**,
and the ethical perspective under consideration is **virtue
ethics**, then a possible research question is:

> Does the practice of virtues [e.g., integrity, zeal, empathy,
> courage---for more details, see p. 460], both at the
> organizational or individual level, promote knowledge transfer;
> what virtues are relevant in this regard and how do they promote
> knowledge transfer (p. 462).

The authors, importantly, note that deontological and
consequentialist ethics focus on actions while virtue ethics focus
on persons (the actors). As such, a research theme from the
perspective of the first two ethical theories will address
questions relate to actions that promote or hinder various
knowledge activities while a research theme from the perspective
of virtue ethics will focus on the role that virtuous actors or
agents have in such activities. The authors go outline, rather
nicely, a number of explicit ways to investigate these issues from
these perspectives.

Overall, the article does an excellent job of outlining the need
for ethical studies in the KM field, describing the important and
most dominant ethical theories, and outlining and detailing
possible ways to address ethical issues in KM research. The
article is a must read for any new KM researcher / student.
