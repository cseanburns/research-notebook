**Note:** The twenty-fifth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Copyright and
Librarians."

It was written by Thorvald Solberg, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Washington, DC (No affiliation)

**Note:** Important text on early copyright issues for librarians.
Rather than the focus today, which is often on term length and
reuse, the focus in the early 20th century concerned accessing
books printed in foreign nations and the requirement that such
books be reprinted by American publishers and printers.

Thorvald Solberg was an important figure in early 20th century
copyright reform.
