This entry is about:

Library Quarterly, 1*(4), 421-435.

**Note:** The fourth article of the fourth issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "The College-Library Book Budget."

It was written by William M. Randall, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** An opening attack on how book budgets are applied at
college libraries. A really good attack. For example, on spending
money based on student population per department:

> It appears obvious, for example, that the number of students
> enrolled in courses in economics in College A can have no
> possible effect upon the number of authoritative and necessary
> books published during a year in the subject (p. 421).

The second argument is an argument against lapsing or *use it or
lose it* budgets.

**Note:** Randall claims that knowing two pieces of information
would help solve the book budgeting problem:

1. Average cost of book per academic deparment
2. Average number of books published per academic deptartment per
   year (see p. 422).

**Reflection:** I think this is the first truly obsolete article
I've read in these first issues of *LQ*. Randall's [previous
article](/blog/2013/08/16/lq-vol-1-issue-1-article-9-reading-study/)
is relevant in many ways, but this one may be so only for
historical purposes.

I should add that I do not meant to minimize the importance of
this article. In fact, I think this article's lack of currency
suggests that this is an area (collection management) that library
science has truly advanced.

I'm enjoying this article so much. This is great (simpler times):

> But, since the list has 149 titles in economics during one
> interval, and 275 titles in English during the corresponding
> interval, it seems reasonable to suppose that the college
> library will need to buy, on the average, about twice as many
> titles in English as in economics during a given period (exactly
> 275/149) (p. 425).

**Note:** Essentially, what Randall is suggesting is a collection
development algorithm based on normalizing around the number of
books published in the field of *English*. It's original and
ingenious and fun to read. The method he proposes is also very
thorough and well thought out, even if outdated. 

For example, it's coming out in the article that one of the
benefits of his method is that it highlights discrepancies in
funding and collections. Thus, his method could have been used to
highlight what is a fair distribution of books per academic
department.

**Note:** And here's the kicker. This is what the *LQ* is all
about--a *Library Science*, at least in these early years:

> This article is intended not as a final word on any of the
> questions of which it treats. It is intended rather as an
> introduction and a sample of the sort of work which may be done
> upon the problems of the college library--and upon all library
> problems in general--by the use of methods which have been
> tested in other disciplines; and by the utilization of available
> data which can be proved reliable. It would appear that the
> proper procedure for the library profession at this time is not
> to seek in every case practical and immediate application of
> knowledge to everyday problems, so much as to investigate
> hypotheses, and to test the assumption upon which the profession
> works (p. 435).
