**Note:** The third article of the third issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Student Load in Library
Schools."

It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Columbia University

**Note:** This article should be interesting. The aim is
to simply gather an understanding of the norms around
course loads. The data is based on a survey sent to
schools that are members of the then Association of
American Library Schools. Members of the individual
schools collected data in a number of ways, and Reece
comments on this in the first page or so of the article.

**Note:** Here is one area that computers may have
helped solve or lessen the problem of:

> There might seem to be an element of bad management in
> expecting the student who has spent several hours on a
> book selection problem to devote further hours to
> typing it (p. 253).

**Note:** Lot of discussion about what is a proper work
load for students. Good stuff but also ordinary.
However, the gist of Reece's argument can be summed up
with this thoughtful closing remark:

> The aim should be to compose courses not only in such
> a way as to obviate congestion and panic but so as to
> permit the serving of readily assimilable rather than
> large portions, and so as to leave leisure for the
> imagination of the student to play upon the material
> presented; and finally to bring classes to the close
> of the year with a sense of having done not too
> superficially the work undertaken, and with the vigor
> and enthusiasm necessary for effective effort in the
> library field (p. 264).
