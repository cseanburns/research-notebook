**Note:** The fifth and last article of the second issue of *The
Library Quarterly* is titled "The Dentition of 'Equus Donatus.'"
It was written by Pierce Butler, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** The Newberry Library

**Note:** This is an interesting essay by one of the founders of
the term *library science,* specifically in his role as a
librarian at The Newberry Library, one of the great American
research libraries.

**Note:** The essay begins by noting the importance gifts have
been to libraries in America's history. Then it proceeds to make a
case that an understanding of philanthropy and libraries is
necessary for a theory of librarianship to develop (probably still
true today).

Butler then offers a critique that focuses on the purpose of
collecting rare books when compared to the social mission of the
library and the library's commitment to its community. This seems
to be the real value of the essay, although the specifics are
important for other reasons too. It's a nice use of a heuristic:
the library has a mission, and if something violates that mission,
even if that something seems to align with it, then what violates
must be examined and possibly set aside, no matter how seemingly
worthy it is.
