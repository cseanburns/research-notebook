**Note:** The nineteenth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Order of Books by
Date under Subjects."

It was written by William Stetson Merrill, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Oconomowoc, Wisconsin (No affiliation)

**Note:** While not completely without merit in some cases (such
as in indexes), the author here makes a case for arranging books
in chronological order (most recent last) instead of in
alphabetical order by author. This is because, the author argues,
patrons want the most recent work on a subject rather than what
any particular author has to say about a subject (esp., the author
argues, in books on science and technology and biographies). For
the most part, this is a weird article. But it, at least,
indicates something interesting about how young this subject
matter was at the time---that such a thing could be seriously
presented.
