**Note:** The fourth article of the fourth issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Preservation of Rare
Books and Manuscripts in the Huntington Library."

It was written by Thomas M. Iiams, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** The Huntington Library

**Note:** The first page of the article contains a photograph of a
"vacuum fumigator" that was designed by the library. Incredible
photo. Kind of illustrates how self-sufficient libraries must have
been at the time.

**Note:** This is a particularly interesting comment with regards
to the future development and mission concerning special
collections:

> The creation of "treasure rooms" in several large public and
> university libraries during recent years shows a definite trend
> toward conservation for posterity, making it clear that
> librarians in research institutions are become definitely
> receptive to ideas other than those mainly governing the purchas
> and circulation of books (p. 375).

**Note:** The article is about bookworms, or the treatment of
books that are plagued by bookworms. I did not expect this.

**Note:** When the librarians at Huntington started searching for
a solution to the pest, they sometimes received this humorous
response:

> Others reported that their libraries were free from all insect
> pests, and seemed a bit surprised to learn that there was a
> bookworm other than the human variety (p. 376).

**Note:** The bookworms (a kind of beetle) were a serious problem
(not just for the library but for the sake of preserving
knowledge). While the article is written with some humor at times,
it does also reflect the gravity the situation and what is at
stake. Consider:

> Bear in mind, also, that in each case we had to satisfy
> ourselves that there would be no deleterious effects on the
> materials fumigated, either now or two centuries from now. This,
> of course, necessitated months of research which would have been
> difficult without the very kind co-operation of the California
> Institute of Technology (p. 381).

**Note:** The article does go beyond the issue of bookworms and
discusses climate and other atmospheric concerns, including mold
as well as air polution in industrial cities, related to the
long-term preservation of books. For example:

> Our own investigation indicated that a temperature of 70 F. and
> a relative humidity of 50 per cent, maintained day in and day
> out, are ideal for the proper preservation of books and
> manuscripts. These precise conditions we have been able to
> maintain for about two years. Vellum manuscripts that curled and
> cracked when the humidity was low can now be conveniently
> handled with assurance that gold illuminations will not peel off
> (p. 385).

**Note:** Mentions more work needed with the issue of
