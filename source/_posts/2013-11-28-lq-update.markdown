As of the last article, I have completed a reading of the first
two volumes of *The Library Quarterly*. Two more volumes to go.

This has been an eye opening experience and I'm incredibly
excited about the next two volumes. For some reason, I have the
feeling that the third volume will mark a turning point. I'm not
sure why I feel this way or if it indeed will be true. I need to
quicken the pace and complete the next two volumes by the end of
December or the first week of January.

Basic stats:

* 45 articles
* 40 articles with one author
* 4 articles with two authors
* 1 article with three authors
* 672 pages total
* 15 average pages per article (11 *Mdn*)

A number of authors have contributed more than one
article in these first two volumes:

* Douglas Waples (University of Chicago) = 5 articles
* Ernest J. Reece (Columbia University) = 3 articles
* William M. Randall (University of Chicago) = 3 articles (2 as
  first author and 1 article as 3rd author)
* Floyd W. Reeves (University of Chicago) = 2 articles
* Carlton B. Joeckel (University of Michigan) = 2 articles
* Arnold K. Borden (Dartmouth College) = 2 articles
* Leon Carnovsky (University of Chicago) = 2 articles (1
  article as first author and 1 article as second author)

A number of affiliations are represented but the University of
Chicago dominates (no affiliation indicates that the author did
not have a stated affiliation on the article):

* University of Chicago = 16 articles
* No affiliation = 4 articles
* Columbia University = 4 articles
* University of Michigan = 3 articles
* University of North Carolina = 2 articles
* Dartmouth College = 2 articles

Given how I'm categorizing these posts (as afforded by
[Octopress](http://octopress.org/)), which are simple text files
written in [Markdown](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/maruku.html),
the above counts are collected with some basic
[BASH](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) one-liners, the results
are outputed to a CSV file, cleaned with search and replace (in
[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)), and then imported into
[R](http://www.r-project.org/).

BASH one-liners:

    # Navigate to post directory: octopress/source/_posts/
    # Print all authors for files containg lq in title
    # Greps the metadata for category: e.g., Author-Waples

    grep -ho "Author-[A-Za-z].*," *lq* >> $HOME/authors.csv

    # Print all affiliations containing lq in title
    # E.g., Affil-University of Chicago

    grep -ho "Affil-[A-Za-z].*" *lq* >> $HOME/affil.csv

I haven't tested this out in a rigorous way, but something like
the following should lead the way for counting the pages of the
articles by grepping the bibliographic reference at the top of
each post:

    grep -ho "([0-9]), [0-9].*-[0-9].*" *lq* >> $HOME/pages.csv

Or this:

    grep -ho "Quarterly, [0-9]\*([0-9]), [0-9].*-[0-9].*' *lq-vol*" >> $HOME/pages.csv

There is some error with the above two lines, so I'll need to
investigate why. Probably some issue with my references. But after
they're saved to the CSV file, open them in VIM and replace all
hyphens with some other separator, or simply import into R and use
the hyphen as a separator. E.g., after opening R:

    pages <- read.csv("pages.csv", header = FALSE, sep = "-")

The Octopress post source directory contains posts about topics
other than the *LQ* study, so having a somewhat standard file
naming system helps.
