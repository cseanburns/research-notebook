As of the last article, I have completed a reading of the
first two volumes of *The Library Quarterly*. By my count,
this equals 672 pages of reading and 45 articles with an
average of 15 pages per article (*Mdn* = 11). Two more volumes to
go.

This has been an eye opening experience and I'm incredibly
excited about the next two volumes. For some reason, I have the
feeling that the third volume will mark a turning point. I'm not
sure why I feel this way or if it indeed will be true. I need to
quicken the pace and complete the next two volumes by the end of
December or the first week of January.
