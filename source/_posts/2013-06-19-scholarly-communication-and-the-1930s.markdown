In the second chapter of [From Documentation to Information
Science][1], Farkas-Conn provides a table that summarizes [Watson
Davis][2]' ideas on the advantages of microfilm over print for
scholarly communication. Before I list a few of these, I should
note that Davis was the founder of the American Documentation
Institute, now the [Association for Information Science and
Technology][3].

The reason I'm marking this is because many of Davis' advantages
would, it seems to me, be strikingly similar to the kinds of
things we'd say about the advantages of many of today's emerging
technologies in scholarly communication. The understanding, then,
is that while we might be experiencing a number of emerging
technologies, we're not really experiencing an emerging
*paradigm*, to apply, perhaps, an overused term. That paradigm
began in the 1930s, when entities such as the ADI were founded.

According to Farkas-Conn's summary of Davis' advantages, microfilm
offered the following advantages over print:

* Chances of duplication error -- none
* Cost of producing copies -- trivial
* Tailored bibliographies -- "As individual as desired" (p. 26).
* Bridging new data to old data -- much simpler

There are a few other listed advantages, but these seem to be the
most pertinent in today's context.

Another instance that things today are not so new:

When I was working on my Ralph H. Parker (the first librarian to
begin automating a library: in 1936) research, I was able to
listen to an oral history recorded with him in the 1970s. (The
entire interview is only accessible on site but excerpts can
accessed [here][4].) There was a part of the interview where he
discussed technologies that he and others at the time thought
would be available in the not so distant future. He was referring,
by today's names, to tablet and desktop computers. But more than
that, he thought that these things would be important
communication devices (connected by satellite) and would not only
be able to retrieve bibliographic references but entire texts. The
main obstacles, he noted, were economical constraints and
copyright issues (the interview took place just before passage of
the [Copyright Act of 1976][5], which he and other librarians were
concerned about at the time). The emphasis on communication is an
important one -- because at that time, and before, computing
devices were not commonly thought of as communication devices (the
Internet existed but not the web).

If there is a so-called paradigm shift due to the availability and
use of today's emerging technologies, the question I keep coming
back to is what will that shift mean for academic libraries. In
1981, Arthur T. Hamlin (who referred to the 1930s as the research
libraries' *mirabilis*) wrote in his book, [The University Library
in the United States: Its Origins and Developments][5], that

> As long as universities continue to be instruments of research,

> Means will be found, possibly not to house tens and hundreds of

> records of the future (p. 109).

If this is to be the mission of today's research and academic
libraries, how will it be carried out in an age where users
searching for and retrieving scholarly documentation can do so
without the benefit of an academic library: e.g., using something
like Google to search for and retrieve something like an open
access article? Because that ability entails that libraries do not
necessarily have to be involved in either preserving or providing
access to these records. So, does it mean that the mission of
these libraries will have to change in response to these new
developments? A fundamental revision of this purpose would be, I
think, an instance of a paradigm shift.
