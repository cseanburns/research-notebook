This entry is about:

Waples, Douglas. (1933). Graduate theses accepted by
library schools in the United States from June, 1928, to
June, 1932. *The Library Quarterly, 3*(3), 267-291.

**Note:** The fourth article of the third issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Graduate theses accepted by library schools in the
United States from June, 1928, to June, 1932."

It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** In an examination of Master's theses coming
out of library schools, Waples asks:

> What is the field of librarianship as defined by the
> 148 theses reported?

The question reminded me of a more [current *LQ*
article][1], which I thought might cite Waples, but
doesn't.

**Note:** The paragraph below captures what this entire
enterprise is about: what is the one, necessary purpose
of the library?

> There is no question, of course, but that libraries
> will endure, as they always have endured, if only for
> the purpose of preserving records that each age
> considers important---witness the pyramids of Gizeh.
> But now the question of most immediate importance is
> how many and which of the other recreational and

Waples assumes it's preserving records, and he assumes
that for good reason. But now that records are
increasingly decentralized, the question is whether that
will remain a continuing assumption. Perhaps it is "the
other recreational and educational values" that will
become the necessary purpose of the library. This is
part of the modern question, it seems to me.

**Note:** As a reminder, this article was published
amidst the Great Depression. One concern that Waples is
addressing concerns the relevancy of libraries in such
times.

**Note:** Here is one instance where the early library
scientists defined one of the fundamental questions of
the field:

> To attack the problems directly may require some
> change in professional attitudes toward the reading
> needs of the community. For example, some studies may
> best proceed from the assumption that the economic
> situation requires the public library, by analogy with
> the tax-supported schools, to identify those now
> receiving its benefits in order to make plain that it
> reaches a sufficiently large and diversified part of
> the population to justify public support; to show that
> certain benefits of reading are not so readily
> obtained from other distributing agencies; and to
> specify the scope of benefits peculiar to library
> services. From this point of departure, **the
> definition of the library's social benefits is a task
> to which some students of librarianship should devote
> their full energies.** The problems which need to be
> studied from this point of view have consequently
> suggested our headings \[emphasis added\] (pp.
> 269-270).

**Note:** Table 1 on page 271 lists the theses subjects.
In my study of the history of library science, I need to
find and read these.

Waples asks:

> "What is the field of librarianship as defined by the
> theses?" (p. 271).

Here's the paragraph that outlines the theses:

> The field of librarianship as defined by the titles in
> general terms in Table 1. The headings for the three
> of the classes are ambiguous, namely, "Description of
> current library practices," "Library organization,"
> and "All others." The forty-one theses classed as
> description of current practice are subdivided as
> follows: twelve on cataloguing and classification,
> nine on book selection, eight on educational
> activities, five on library extension, two on
> interlibrary lending, two on lending and circulation,
> and three on general practices. Library organization,
> with the exclusion of historical and survey
> treatments, is represented by eleven theses---two on
> legislation, four on finance, two on buildings, and
> three on holdings. "All others" include seventeen
> theses: seven in the field of reading, three on
> publishing, four on criteria for library services, and
> three on sources and methods of research (pp.
> 271-272).

**Note:** Waples compares these theses with non-library
PhD dissertations that are about libraries in some way
and that were published in 1930. It's not entirely clear
what areas or fields have launched these dissertations,
but Waples provides a way to track them down.
