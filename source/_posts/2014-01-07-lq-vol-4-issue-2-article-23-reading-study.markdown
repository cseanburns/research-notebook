**Note:** The twenty-third article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Forest of Pencils:
Adventures in Corporate Entry."

It was written by Harriet Wheeler Pierson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Library of Congress

**Note:** Probably the best title in these first volumes so far.
Begins with a short history of the Chinese Emporer Taitsung and
his founding of a library that lasted for 1200 years only to be
burned down during the Boxer rebellion in 1900.

**Note:** Although this is an important and very complicated
topic, I think the following is humorous, and I think, given how
this article reads in general, that it is meant to be humorous
(see, e.g., last paragraph on page 312):

> particularly did he \[J. C. M. Hanson\] clarify the rules for
> corporate entry, a subject more open to differences of opinion
> than, perhaps, any other (p. 307).

**Note:** Here ya go:

> Catalogers are not only transcribers, they are seekers of truth.

**Note:** I celebrate this author's passion, as I read her voice
from the past.

> To the uninitiated the profession of cataloging may appear dry
> and uninteresting; in reality there is no profession which
> affords so great an opportunity to look into the mirror of life.
> The revelation is absorbing and full of interesting surprises: a
> glimpse of beauty in some forgotten volume, a flash of humor
> from some dusty shelf. The voices of the past are audible, their
> joy and pain, their triumph and defeat, their ambition and
> resignation, their eager and unending struggle to solve the
> mystery of life (p. 313).
