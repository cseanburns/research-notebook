**Note:** The second article of the second issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "National libraries in
China."

It was written by A. Kaiming Chiu, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Harvard University

**Note:** As the title indicates, this article is about the
national libraries in China. There were three of them at the time,
and all were open to the public. This should be a really
interesting article. Chiu will discuss their history, their
collections, and how the collections are organized.

**Reflection:** Just a side thought. Since I know very little
about Chinese libraries, this article may or may not impact me as
much as, for example, previous articles on topics I'm very close
to have (e.g., articles on library school education, etc.). So it
may be, as it has been with other articles that are outside my
experience, that I may post very little in this entry. I need to
examine which of my posts are the longest. That should say
something about which articles have meant the most to me. But also
look at which posts are the shortest -- identify my areas of
weakness or areas that may be of interest at a later time.

**Note:** Some interesting stuff on classification in here. Not a
whole lot though (yet).

**Note:** Discussion of readership, circulation, catalogs,
reference works such as gazetteers, encyclopedias, rare works,
printing, stone tablets, maps, paintings, manuscripts.

Regarding The National Library of Peiping, too bad:

> The library seems unwilling to make known its classification
> system until it has perfected it (p. 160).

**Note:** On page 167, an interesting description of the rules
that resident research scholars had to follow at The National
Sinological Library of Nanking.

**Note:** Alfred Kaiming Chiu was an interesting person. This
seems to be a brief biography:
