**Note:** The first article of the second issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Service of
Libraries in Promoting Scholarship and Research."

It was written by Louis R. Wilson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** Article begins with a description of two new libraries
"devoted exclusively to the purposes of scholarship and research"
(p. 127). The section concludes with a description of the
article's purpose:

> Let us consider briefly, and largely by means of illustration,
> five types of service which American libraries are effectively
> rendering the scholar today. They are: (1) the accumulation of
> materials; (2) making materials available; (3) personal
> assistance to scholars; (4) directing research and publication;
> and (5) aiding scholarship through international co-operation
> (p. 128).

This is a timely discussion.

**Note:** The next seven pages document the efforts many
university and special libraries have made in order to build
collections in the first part of the 20th century. This section
contains valuable historical information and includes a
discussion, among other things, of various cooperative efforts.

**Note:** The next section, on "making materials available,"
begins with a discussion of library buildings and the use of them
for reading. Then comes a segment on libraries providing catalogs
to its users. This includes,

> the development of a complete dictionary catalogue of its
> holdings, with duplicate catalogues for departmental libraries,
> indexes of periodicals and proceedings of learned societies,
> printed catalogues of other notable libraries, and
> bibliographical and critical apparatus concerning all the
> subjects contained in the holdings of the library (p. 136).

Even as early as 1933, television (as an electronic information
technology) was considered a possible tool for libraries. See last
paragraph of last section on p. 138.

**Note:** The next section is on "personal assistance to
scholars." Here's a key point:

> In most libraries emphasis has very naturally been placed on the
> acquisition of materials and their preparation for use. Too
> seldom has it been placed on assistance in use. But this is
> changing (p. 139).

Wilson proceeds to document the many ways that librarians are
doing expert work in the services they provide to scholars. Many
of these services are still done today although some may look a
little different given changes in various technologies.

**Note:** The next section is on "directing research and
publication." The discussion focuses on librarians as scholars
amidst scholars. That is, the focus is not only on librarians as
scholars, but it is also on the unique position librarians have as
scholars because they are not tied to any specific department but
are institutionally oriented.

I like this line on the importance of bibliography:

> His service to bibliography, the starting-point and foundation
> of all sound investigation, has been of inestimable value as he
> has given it precision and form (p. 142).

**Note:** The next section is on "aiding scholarship through
international co-operation." Discusses the beginnings of IFLA.
More generally, it discusses the kinds of activities librarians
among various nations have worked together exchange documents and
help build each others libraries.

**Note:** Wilson finally asks the following question:

> What have libraries done, and what are they doing to kindle the
> enthusiasms of youth and to make men scholars (p. 144).

He draws from a letter written by a former student and then he
writes this really eloquent bit:

> His letter stopped here, but I can imagine something further.
> One day, while at work with rare books or early manuscripts, or
> in conference with his instructor in the library, a new spirit
> stirred within him. The passing of graduate courses, as such,
> ceased to be a goal. Knowledge of the civilization of which the
> books or manuscripts were evidences became a passion ... (p.
> 144).

**Note:** Wilson ends by stating that while he doesn't know the
magnitude of the effect that libraries have produced in their aid
to scholars, he does believe that libraries are a necessary
condition for scholarship.

Really nice piece.
