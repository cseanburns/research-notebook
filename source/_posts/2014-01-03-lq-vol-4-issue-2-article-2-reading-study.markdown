**Note:** The second article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Dilemmas of
Classification."

It was written by John Ansteinsson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Tekniske Höiskole

**Note:** The author wrestles with some very fundamental problems
with classification, and these problems deal not only with
*aboutness* but also with direction. Consider an experiment by a
chemist and one by a physicist, each examining much the same thing
but from different perspectives:

> The subjects of the two investigations are to a large extent
> identical, the results coincide almost entirely, or at least to
> such an extent that the two authors are disputing over the
> priority. Nevertheless, the problem has been attacked by them
> from different points of view, even with different aims in view,
> and in any case through different methods. The one probably is
> physical chemistry, the other one perhaps chemical physics.
> According to the two systems of classification most in use in
> America, the one would go into physics, the other into
> chemistry. But the walls of our pigeonholes are smashed to
> pieces by the incessant bombardment of radiations from the
> restless atoms oscillating between our nicely built-up
> compartments, all of which want to occupy the same space in our
> system (p. 140).

**Note:** On a book with many topics:

> Are we to pick our book to pieces and scatter it in the various
> places in the system where the different parts belong, or are we
> to put it into one of them which will do justice to only a minor
> part of the contents (p. 141)?

**Note:** What I enjoy about these early classification and
cataloging articles is how well they bring to light the attempt to
form and complete a rational system.
