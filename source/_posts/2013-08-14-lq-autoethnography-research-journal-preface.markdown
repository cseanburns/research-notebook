**Note:** Instead of inserting this preface in each post, I'll now
link to it.

**Preface:**

This post is part of a series of field notes on an
autoethnographic reading of [*The Library
Quarterly*](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/lq.html).
The collection can be accessed by visiting the following link:

[http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/](http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/)

For an explanation of the project, see:

[http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/2013/07/19/authoethnography-abstract/](http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/2013/07/19/authoethnography-abstract/)

**Reading and Posting Guide:**

My comments, writings, etc. begin with the term **Note**. Each new
thought begins with that term. Follow up paragraphs, if any, will
not.

My reflections will begin with the term **Reflection**. These may
usually be posted toward the end of the post, but may also be
interspersed throughout the document. I'll see how it goes.

If I am quoting a term, I may quote it within a **Note**, that is,
within my text. If I am quoting a phrase, a sentence, or something
longer, I will quote it as a block quote.

All quotes are assumed to be by the author of the paper under
investigation. If I quote another source, I will add the author's
name, year, and page number after that quote: e.g., (Author, Year,
p. n).

Because these are notes, they are not heavily edited for grammar.
