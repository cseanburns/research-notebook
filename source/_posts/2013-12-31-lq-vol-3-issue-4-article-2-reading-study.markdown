**Note:** The second article of the fourth issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Anonyms and
Pseudonyms: An Annotated List."

It was written by Adah V. Morris, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan

**Note:** This is the first article that I've only skimmed and not
read thoroughly. The reason is that it is an annotated
bibliography (rather than a standard narrative of some wort) of
reference works related to anonyms and pseudonyms. As the author
states:

> This list has been compiled as an aid to librarians and
> cataloguers in the purchase and use of books which treat of
> anonymous and pseudonymous literature (p. 354).

**Note:** The article begins with a description of the list and
how it was compiled. It has the following sections:

- General
- American and English
- Dutch and Belgian
- French
- German
- Hebrew
- Hungarian
- Italian
- Scandinavian
- Slavic
- Spanish, Spanish-American, Portuguese
