**Note:** The twenty-second article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The University
Library and Research."

It was written by A. C. Noé, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** Herein is a really interesting argument about the
advantages that librarians as bibliographers can provide to
scientists who lack the assistants and machinery to produce the
equivalent of what scientists in, as the author explicitly names,
Germany can produce. The author's analogy:

> Does this difference in personnel help permanently to condemn
> the American professor to a position of relative inferiority in
> research work? This question can perhaps be answered by a
> comparison with the American farmer. The latter has also much
> less help than a western European farmer, and yet he produces
> more per man than any other agriculturalist in the world. He
> does it through superior organization of work and through the
> use of machinery. The same could be true of the American
> research worker. What he lacks in assistants and technicians
> could, in a measure, be replaced by organization and
> machinery---both to be supplied by departments of bibliographic
> research in university libraries (p. 300).
