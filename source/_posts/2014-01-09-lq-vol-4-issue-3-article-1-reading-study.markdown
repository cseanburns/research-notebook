**Note:** The first article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Preservation of
Records in Libraries."

It was written by B. W. Scribner, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Bureau of Standards

**Note:** This piece is largely an update to an earlier article by
Scribner on preservation. See [Scribner,
1931](/blog/2013/10/10/lq-vol-1-issue-4-article-3-reading-study/).

It is also, I believe, the third article dealing with
preservation. The other one is [Iiams,
1932](/blog/2013/11/27/lq-vol-2-issue-4-article-4/).
