**Note:** The fourth article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Copies of Collateral References for
College Libraries."

It was written by Margie M. Hely, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Western Kentucky State

**Note:** The author defines collateral reading as "'outside
reading'" (p. 421) that is related to coursework.

**Note:** Brilliant:

> Records kept by the writer over a period of many weeks from two
> reserve desks revealed that there are relationships between
> these factors which remain constant. The number of students
> multiplied by the number of pages each must read will give the
> total number of pages to be read by all the students. The number
> of pages read per hour by the typical student multiplied by the
> length of the average loan in terms of an hour will give the
> number of pages read by the typical student during one average
> loan period. If the first product (the total number of pages) be
> divided by the second product (the number of pages read by the
> typical student ini one loan period), the number of loans needed
> for all the students will be ascertained. Then if this total
> number of loans be divided by the number of loans one book may

It's a common theme that early authors were very concerned with
coming up with objective methods and measures.

*Library Science* arises out of a push for this objectivity.

Another example:

> The number of pages that an average student can read in an hour
> was believed to be a determining factor. From Mr. Ivan A.
> Booker, assistant director of research, National Education
> Association, it was found that his studies of the reading rates
> of college freshmen entering the University of Chicago in the
> fall term of 1930 and of 1931 revealed the mean rate of 3.68
> words per second for the first year and 3.83 words per second
> for the second year (p. 424).

I couldn't help myself. I just timed my reading of this article
and clocked myself in at 6.25 words per second (375 words in 60
seconds). I guess I beat college freshmen from 1930.

**Note:** As I said, brilliant. After proposing a formula for
determining how many reserve books a course will need, she tests
it:

> At Western Kentucky State Teachers College an instructor in a
> psychology class purchased with department funds five copies of
> Warren and Carmichael's **Human Psychology**. He placed them at
> the reserve desk with the comment that these were believed to be
> sufficient. Two weeks elapsed and he came to say that his
> students were complaining that they did not have enough books.
> With facts about his class and the assignment furnished, the
> librarian used the formula to determine how many copies his
> class needed.
>
> a = 50 students in the class  
> b = Approximately 50 pages to be read per week  
> c = 28 pages read per hour by the typical student  
> k<sub>1</sub> = 0.62 hours (37 min.) per average loan  
> k<sub>2</sub> = 19 loans per average week  
>
> Substituting in the formula, we get
>
> a X b / c X k<sub>1</sub> / k<sub>2</sub> =  
> 50 X 50 / 28 X 0.62 / 19 =  
> 50 X 50 / 28 X 0.62 X 19 =  
> 7+, or 8 copies (p. 432).  

Incapable of reproducing the exact representation of the above
calculations.

She then writes:

> The five copies had evidently been too few. The instructor
> agreed to purchase three extra copies, and no further
> difficulties were reported throughout the three remaining months
> of the semester. Since each copy is good for about nineteen
> loans to a week, the class was short fifty-seven loans. No
> wonder they were in trouble. The instructor was completely
> converted to the efficacy of the formula (p. 433).

**Reflection:** This is an important article not because of the
findings but because it represents a way of going about solving a
problem that was representative of the time period and of the
beginnings of library science.
