**Note:** The tenth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Call Numbers."

It was written by A. G. Drachmann, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University Library

**Note:** Begins with a very neat description of the University
Library in Copenhagen, Denmark before call numbers were used. 
Insightful. And then describes the process of incorporating call
numbers into the system given various constraints.

His proposal, or at least his arguments for his proposal, seem
overly complicated and based all too much on reasoning than on
some evidence. But I shouldn't judge too harshly from this far
into the future.
