**Note:** The tenth article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Fritz Milkau,
September 28, 1859-January 23, 1934."

It was written J. C. M. Hanson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** No Affiliation (Sister Bay, Wisconsin)

**Note:** From his retirement, Hanson writes this tribute to Fritz
Milkau, an important German librarian.

**Note:** As a side note, I haven't researched the length it took
for these articles to go from submission to publication, but the
death of Milkau (end of January) and the publication of this
article (last volume of the year) provides a bit of a clue. Other
articles have mentioned current years (the last one did), so my
guess would be that it took less than a year for an article to go
through the process.

**Reflection:** This is the last article in my study.
