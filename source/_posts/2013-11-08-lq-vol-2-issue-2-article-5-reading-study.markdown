**Note:** The fifth article of the second issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Seventeeth-Century
American Libraries."

It was written by Arnold K. Bordern, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Dartmouth College

**Note:** This is a really neat history. Consider how important a
thesaurus was:

> One gentleman, for instance, made a gift in 1849 to the Harvard
> Library of a thesaurus, in four volumes, upon condition that he
> would have free access to it at any time and that, in the event
> of having a son who needed it, he might have the privilege of
> recovery (pp. 139-140).

**Note:** Nice description of the public library (p. 140) built by
the will of Captain Robert Keayne (see also Jesse Shera's
[*Foundations of the Public Library*][1].

**Note:** There's a story about a man named Increase Mather and
his library. Turns out Increase Mather is the father of Cotton
Mather. Didn't know that. Interesting names.

**Note:** Regarding Reverend Thomas Bray:

> It is difficult, in any discussion of early libraries, to
> eliminate the Reverend Thomas Bray, rector in the 1690s of the
> church of Sheldon, England (pp. 145-146).

And:

> His genius presided over the origin of so many collections that
> he is easily entitled to the nook of a prophet in the history of
> libraries (pp. 146-147).

**Note:** Nice, short history. Pleasure to read. Borden's second
article in *LQ* so far.
