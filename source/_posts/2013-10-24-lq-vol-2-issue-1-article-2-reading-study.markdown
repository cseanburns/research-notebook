**Note:** The second article of the first issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Library Planning in
Teacher-Training Institutions."

It was written by Donna E. Sullivan, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** State Normal School

**Note:** An analysis of the various kinds of libraries in service
to teachers colleges.

**Note:** Sullivan begins by highlighting the contributions that
[normal schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_school) have
made to teaching but notes that the model has become outdated and
there is currently a transition to the teachers college. In
essence, the transition is comparable to one from a vocational
school to a four year degree.

**Note:** With the rise in teacher colleges at the time, Sullivan
makes the argument that they will need good libraries to serve
their students. It's an argument for a library that fits the needs
of a particular college rather than an entire university.

**Note:** Very interesting turn. The title of the article *Library
Planning* refers to actual space planning and the arguments
Sullivan provides are directed toward the good use of a library,
current and future. She incorporates blueprints to make her point
about certain arrangements. She even highlights "working
arrangements" (p. 15). So her concern is not just about library
users (including students and faculty) but also about library
workers.

**Note:** Longstanding tradition to have a library of children's
literature for teacher colleges:

> Of the three rooms, the one at the front of the building is
> devoted to a model children's library and is a non-circulating
> collection of books used in the course in children's literature
> taken by the students in the kindergarten-primary course. The
> middle room is known as the "children's room," and here the
> children's librarian has her desk ... (p. 19).

**Note:** I haven't read Matthew Griffis' dissertation ["Space,
Power and the Public Library: A Multicase Examination of the
Public Library as Organization
Space"](http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/1103/), but I've heard him
present a couple times (excellent presenter and very interesting
topic) about the use of space in public libraries (within the
context of [Michel
Foucault](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/foucault/) and the
[*panopticon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon)). I
wonder how he'd comment on this passage, which suggests that the
intent is to place the library's desk in a location that helps
library users rather than librarians.

> On the second floor the outstanding features are the librarian's
> desk in the main delivery lobby, always visible and available;
> (p. 19).

(Just brought this up with a colleague who walked by my office and
we had a great conversation about it.)

**Note:** I'm seeing a similar effect here at UK with the
construction of the new dormitories near the main library:

> With the allotment of these rooms to other departments more use
> of the library developed. The students no longer consider the
> walk from classrooms to library a task, and the end of each
> class hour sees great numbers of them going to and from between
> the buildings (p. 29).

**Note:** There's a line at the top of page 35 that makes me
wonder whether the design of academic libraries in cities may have
been influenced by the needs of students commuting to the city
from suburbia -- who would have needed a place to read and study
while they were on campus.

**Note:** The argument for the library's central position /
location on a campus is essentially an argument about equal access
to information, except from geographic perspective:

> In planning a building for the library of a teachers college, a
> number of important points immediately come to mind. A central
> location is desirable, that all students from the various other
> buildings and departments may reach the library in approximately
> the same time and share equally in having "first choice" of the
> books in demand. 

**Note:** The reserve room makes its appearance into the library:

> With the present methods of instruction, where individual
> textbooks have been retired into the background and students are
> referred to a number of books for each course, need for housing
> these books constantly in demand in one place has become a
> necessity, and the reserve-book room has appeared upon the scene
> to fill this need (p. 36).

**Note:** The expected (at that time) life expectancy of a library
building (at least at a teachers college):

> In planning a library building a careful estimate of the maximum
> possible growth of the student numbers and library books should
> be used as a basis on which to compute the needs for the next
> few decades. To plan for a few years is not sufficient; new
> libraries do not drop down into outstretched hands whenever the
> olds ones become crowded, and a new building must serve for
> thirty, forty, or fifty years (p. 39).

**Note:** I still occasionally hear about problems when one
doesn't listen to the other.

> Hearty co-operation between the architect and the librarian is a
> state to be encouraged, and a most satisfactory library can be
> the result of united effort on the part of these two, with, of
> course, certain concessions on the part of both (pp. 40-41).

**Reflection:** This is an insightful article. According to Google
Scholar, it's only been cited twice. That's a shame.
