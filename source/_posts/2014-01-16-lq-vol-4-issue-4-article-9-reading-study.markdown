**Note:** The ninth article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Shall the Library
Board Be Retained?"

It was written George F. Bowerman, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Public Library (Washington, D.C.)

**Note:** Public library governance was a major concern at the
time. Not just the quality of governance, but the actual system of
governance. Off the cuff, I think this is the fourth article on
the broad topic (but there may be more) in these early volumes.
The three I can immediately recall are:

- [Joeckel, 1931a][1]
- [Joeckel, 1931b][2]
- [Wachtel, 1933][3]

**Note:** One apparently persistent theme is a tension between
public libraries and institutions of public education. Consider
lines like this:

> The specialized interests of the library should not be
> jeopardized by being merged with, and submerged by, the
> overshadowing interests of the schools (p. 644).

**Note:** Important historical perspective:

> The recognized authoritative publication on the public library
> in America is **The American public library** by Dr. Arthur E.
> Bostwick, librarian of the St. Louis Public Library and former
> president of the American Library Association (p. 646).

The author quotes both Bostwick and Joeckel.

Additional sources:

- Thomas H. Reed. (1934). *Municipal Government in the United
  States.* New York: Appleton-Century. 
- William B. Munro. (1934). *Municipal Administration*.

Nice article on the importance of the library board.
