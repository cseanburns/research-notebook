**Note:** The first article of the fourth issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "Suggestions regarding an Evaluation of
Methods in Current Adult-Education Practices."

It was written by Leon Carvovsky, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago 

**Note:** Seems there will be some criticism of adult education,
at least as it was represented as a movement at the time. Also
mentions, off the bat, education psychology.

**Note:** I've read about the use of forums in American history
before and have a general idea where the article I read is
located,  but this bit connecting adult education and **forums**
is interesting and new to me, when presented in this way:

> One of the best-known forms of adult education in America is the
> forum. The forum goes back a considerable distance in American
> history, and it has achieved some prominence in recent times
> through being linked up with the adult-education movement.
> Indeed, owing to this connection, it is probable that the public
> forum is more extensive today in American than it has ever been
> in the past. The main features of the forum are three. There is
> an address, usually by a fluent-speaker, often one who has
> achieved some distinction in his field, sometimes one who has
> become popular through his facility of expression rather than
> his scholarship. Sometimes a debate between two prominent
> persons is substituted for the address. Following the address
> the meeting is open to the audience, and questions relating to
> the topic of the evening are asked of the speaker. Sometimes
> these are written, more often oral (p. 378).

**Note:** Carnovsky has the following bit on learning, and I think
given the relationship between public libraries and learning, the
following list should be considered in any in-depth discussion of
that relationship. He writes:

> It remains now to ask what evidence is at hand for an evaluation
> of the aims and method of the forum as described. One type of
> such evidence consists in the principles that are known to
> operate in the learning process. It is both possible and
> convenient to consider these principles as representing at least
> eight types of learning, which are of course by no means
> discrete:  
> 1. Acquisition of acts of skill  
> 2. Developing adequate perceptions and habits of observation  
> 3. Acquiring associations and memorizing  
> 4. Acquiring ideas or knowledge  
> 5. Gaining understanding and problem-solving  
> 6. Developing appreciations  
> 7. Developing attitudes  
> 8. Developing character (p. 379).

He then relates **forums** to item 4 on the list, at least that is
what they predominantly seem to be about. Then he uses
"psychological evidence" to support this claim. Interesting.

**Note:** There may be an exception or two, but I don't think I'll
report more details about this article any further in this post.
But, a few things to note:

- There is a very real purpose in this article, and that is to get
  researchers to know more, to measure more, and so forth, what is
  going on in adult learning. The beginning of this article is
  focused on forums, but I imagine (I'm still reading) that
  Carnovsky will address other types of learning formats.
- The idea of a forum, as described in this article, is relevant
  in today's context. This is because his description of forums
  and their purpose has a conceptual relationship, although
  obviously antecedent, to how MOOCs are presented today.

**Note:** On the "university extension movement" and distance
education over 80 years ago:

> In general, the purpose of university extension is to take, in
> so far as possible, the university to the student who is unable
> to attend in person (p. 387).

**Note:** Description of correspondence instruction:

> The method of instruction is correspondence. In general, the
> procedure is as follows: definitely organized lesson sheets are
> sent to the student at certain intervals. Assignments consist of
> required reading and suggested readings, and exercises which are
> mailed back to the university for correction or criticism, after
> which they are returned to the student. There is, of course, no
> personal supervision in the sense of a face-to-face
> relationship, but it would be a mistake to assume that personal
> direction is lacking. On the contrary such direction is very
> much a part of the system (p. 388).

I wonder if that's the first instance of the phrase
*face-to-face*--especially in nearly the same context we use it
today.

**Note:** Carnovsky finally describes how libraries and librarians
have been involved in adult education. This was largely through
reader advisory, or the personalized reading list for the patron.
There is some criticism of this as a way of instruction. Here
Carnovsky quotes a "Professor L. J. Richardson, director of the
University of California Extension Division," who concludes after
providing a list of reasons why readers advisory is not a good
instructional program:

> It is evidence that a course of reading, however carefully
> planned, cannot meet all the needs involved in adult education
> (p. 392).

**Note:** One last note about the article and especially its
method. Carnovsky's method is to describe the thing under
question, or the *data* as he terms it, and then tie the
description to a psychological statement or principle about
learning. This makes his *preface* intelligible (that is, I didn't
understand what he was doing when I first read it):

> NOTE ON SOURCES:--Data concerning practices in adult education
> are found in the "Studies in adult education," sponsored by the
> Carnegie Corporation, as indicated in the footnotes. The
> psychological principles employed were taken from the
> unpublished "Official record of the Commonwealth Teacher
> Training Study," by Charters and Waples. The principles were
> selected from over one hundred texts in educational psychology
> by \[...\], as supported by experimental evidence (p. 377).

From the perspective of an up and coming social scientist who
works at the Graduate Library School, i.e., Carnovsky, this method
is a really interesting tactic.
