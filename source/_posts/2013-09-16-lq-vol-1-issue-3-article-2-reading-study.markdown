**Note:** The second article of the third issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "Origins of Russian Printing."

It was written by Eugene Victor Prostov, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** Based on the topic of this article and the affiliation
with GLS, I think it's safe to say that GLS's first set of faculty
included a scholar of book history. I find that to be interesting.

**Note:** Even when book making was automated (via printing), it
was still hands-on work:

> Skorina cut his own type, ... (p. 258).

**Note:** This is simply a fascinating story. It's also a reminder
that early printing was fueled by religious and political
motivations. Information as power, as commodity, etc.

**Note:** I'm not really targeting the point of this article with
these notes -- just finding a number of interesting tidbits:

> and a much later historian of the books and libraries of Russia,
> Bakhtiarov, mentions, in connection with his description of the
> book-losses sustained by the Russians in the course of the
> French invasion of 1812, that leather-bound books from Bause's
> collection were used by the French soldiers to cover the muddy
> street in front of the house so that carriages could enter the
> yard (p. 265).

You can't do that with information! Only with books. Wait, what?

**Note:** I'd have to read this again to get a better gist of the
story -- to keep track of all the characters involved.
