**Note:** The third article of the first issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
Dormitory Library: An Experiment in Stimulating
Reading."

It was written by Leon Carnovsky, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** The University of Chicago, in the 1931-32,
opened a new dorm that offers new amenities to its
students. Carnovsky seeks to understand how the new
dorm, which has "two library rooms, one at either end of
the building" (p. 37), influences reading.

The rooms (libraries) have ash-trays, a noted
convenience. Interesting.

**Note:** The article does not (yet) make specific
mention of the [previous article][1] that covered the
University of Chicago's new educational plan, but it
does discuss the new dorm with respect to that plan.

**Note:** The Graduate Library School maintains the
dormitory libraries. This is on purpose -- as the School
intentionally desired to maintain these dormitory
libraries in order to study and learn,

> something about reading habits, motives,
> incentives--in short, about reading behavior" (p. 40)

of these students.

**Note:** Carnovsky mentions Kuhlman's article in the
third footnote.

**Note:** Carnovsky and the School kept two records. A
book record recorded titles in circulation. The other
record:

> The reader record was something of an innovation. It
> consisted of a card for each student upon which the
> titles withdrawn by any student were at once written
> (p. 41).

**Note:** Carnovsky discusses various limitations of the
study. See bottom of page 41.

**Note:** Based on Table II (p. 42), it appears students
charged books much less frequently toward the end of the
year than they do at the beginning. Reference books in
circulation are not included in the figures.

**Note:** More limitations discussed on pages 42-43.
Many of these limitations are normal limitations based
on the kind of data that is based on circulation
records. For example, such records cannot indicate the
reading of a book in the library (i.e., one not checked
out).

**Note:** Carnovsky confirms on page 44 that,

> library withdrawals decreased steadily from quarter to
> quarter (p. 44).

**Note:** Carnovsky discusses the reading habits of the
optional books by General Course category. I may not
have noted in this in my Kuhlman notes, but the
University of Chicago's new educational plan included
four areas of educational emphasis:

* Humanities
* Social Sciences
* Biological Sciences
* Physical Sciences

Based on Carnovsky's study, the distribution of reading
is very positively skewed, as it is in most such
distributions, e.g., Bradford. Carnovsky makes this
conclusion:

> Even granting that some reading has taken place of
> which we have no record, it seems safe to conclude
> that the amount of reading done is disappointing. In
> the case of each course, were it not for a few
> individuals who have read somewhat extensively, the
> average number of books borrowed would be altogether
> negligible (p. 49).

**Note:** Carnovsky notes that while reading course
related material may not have been substantial, the
presence of books outside the scope of the courses
(a "general collection of books" p. 50) may have been
substantial. That is, the dormitory libraries may have
influenced reading, just not reading for coursework. He
refers to this as "independent reading" (p. 50). In
light of this scenario, Carnovsky asks the following two
research questions:

> 1\. Are the heavy readers of optional books also heavy
> readers of independent material; and conversely, are
> the light readers of the optional also light readers
> of the independent? Or, more directly in line with the
> proposed hypothesis, are the heavy users of
> independent reading matter among the light readers of
> the optional (p. 50)?

And:

> 2\. What is the relationship between types of material
> read and scholarship? Are the heavy readers of
> independent materials good or poor students; and are
> the non-library users necessarily poor students (p.
> 51).

**Note:** Even though it's a minor sentence in the
whole, Carnovsky makes an important conceptual
distinction here:

> Group two, on the other hand, contained the readers,
> or better, the library users (p. 52).

**Note:** In general, Carnovsky finds, after analyzing
optional and independent reading, that there are a
significant number of non-readers in this total group of
students.

**Note:** Regarding the second question above, some
interesting findings:

> From the data presented it would appear that the more
> optional reading one does, the better one's chances
> for creditably passing the four general courses. This
> is exactly what would be expected, but it is possible
> to go farther. For example, the contrary does not
> necessarily follow: namely, that little or no optional
> reading is necessarily associated with poor grades (p.
> 54).

**Note:** This is not a controlled study and there are a
number of errors related to sampling, mostly, but also
the lack of good statistical tests at the time, that
leave me doubtful of the conclusions here. But Carnovsky
is aware of this limitation:

> Even remembering the qualification that one year's
> experience with a small sample is too limited to
> justify generalizations ... (p. 55).

**Note:** The next few pages discuss the reading habits
of sophomores, juniors, and seniors. In short, they
read more. Carnovsky discusses a few reasons why this
may be the case, which I'll leave out here, and suggests
some future studies that will help explore the issue.

**Note:** On to the reading habits of graduate students.

**Note:** Nice conclusion. Ties together the work done
by librarians and the work done by instructors with the
collective aim to pursue the University's new
educational plan. Faults or no, the implementation of
the educational plan really does seem like it was a
collective effort.

**Note:** Interesting, from a historical perspective,
note about the use of circulation statistics as a
research instrument:

> Finally, the study is perhaps worth undertaking as a
> demonstration of how circulation statistics may be
> used not only to measure the effects of instruction
> but also to study the similarities and differences in
> the reading of college students (p. 31).
