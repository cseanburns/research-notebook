**Note:** The eighth article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "The Compilation of 'A List of Books for College
Libraries.'" It was written by Charles B. Shaw, who was affiliated
with Swarthmore College.

**Note:** The article begins by noting that the Carnegie
Corporation (CC) has taken an interest in academic libraries.
Because of this, librarians are seeking grants from (CC). This may
be the first instance (at a non-trivial scale, at least) of
academic libraries seeking outside funding in the form of grants.

**Note:** This article is turning out to be a humorous account
involving the agreements and disagreements among faculty about the
best works (or the works that a college library should hold) for a
college library. It would make a good collection management class
reading. And the process of dividing up the books by three zones
is interestingly similar to Bradford's Law, which was published
about three after this article.
