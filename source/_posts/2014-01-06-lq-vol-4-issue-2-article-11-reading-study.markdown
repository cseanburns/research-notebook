**Note:** The eleventh article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Classification of
Books in Libraries."

It was written by Colman J. Farrell, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** The Abbey Library

**Note:** This is a critical review of a book on classification
written by a Henry Evelyn Bliss. It's a good review and I'm not
finding much to discuss, but the author raises are very good
question:

> The all-important question, which Bliss's book raises in the
> mind of a classifier of books, is this: why does the author
> propose to discuss the problems of book classification and,
> straightaway, enter into a discussion of the divisions of
> knowledge? Even if there were some kind of identity, why does he
> choose to discuss the problem in terms of knowledge rather than
> in terms of books (p. 213)?

And then Farrell writes:

> This is not a question of "logical" versus "arbitrary"
> procedure, but a question of deductive versus inductive
> procedure (p. 213).

**Note:** More humor:

> It was a formula which led the man with eight white horses and
> two black horses to kill all the white horses when he observed
> that the white horses ate more than the black horses (p. 220).

And so Farrell's criticism in two sentences:

> The method of the author \[Bliss\], therefore, is to "conceive"
> classes. The method of the Library of Congress is to investigate
> the literature to "discover" the classes (p. 220).

It's a delightful critique -- without overtly stating it, it draws
upon a lot of Western philosophy -- including Kant.

And this is very scathing:

> Professors of book classification in library schools will be
> forever indebted to Bliss for this capital illustration of the
> distinction between book classification and the classification
> of knowledge, between the classification of material things as
> they exist in nature and the classification of the limited
> conceptual knowledge as it exists in individual minds. It is one
> of those things which fairly defies explanation until one can
> illustrate it by means of a concrete example (p. 221).

This topic should really be revisited. The argument weighs heavily
on the more modern issue of the **organization of information** as
opposed to the **organization of things**:

> in the organization of knowledge there can be no correlation of
> the abstract with the concrete, but merely a division of an
> abstract whole into immaterial parts. The second distinction is
> found in the procedure: classification of books is necessarily
> synthetic; organization of knowledge can only be analytic (p.
> 222).

**Note:** After highlighting some of the imperfections inherent in
the Library of Congress classification schedule, Farrell write:

> The aspect of the Library of Congress classification schedules
> with which the present writer has not been able to find fault is
> the theory and method which they are grounded. They seem to be
> unimpeachable; and it is a most singular and unfortunate
> phenomenon that the profession as a whole has remained
> oblivious, during the past thirty-five years and apparently to
> this day, of the true nature of the work being done in the
> national library (p. 222).

**Note:** I'm interested in the fact that the author of this
article is a monk of the Order of Saint Benedict (O.S.B) and is
writing from an abbey in Atchison Kansas.

**Note:** Bliss was not always well received (as he
was not here):
