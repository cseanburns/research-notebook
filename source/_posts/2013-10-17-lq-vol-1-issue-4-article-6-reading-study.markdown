**Note:** The sixth and last article of the fourth issue, and last
article of the first volume, of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Johann Neumeister: An Assistant to Johann Gutenberg?"

It was written by Ruth A. Ketring, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Duke University Library

**Note:** A historical piece on printing and bibliography.

**Reflection:** Nothing much to say about the specifics of this
article. In the last few years I've picked up a couple books on
old-school bibliography work (the work of *bibliographers*) in the
last few years. It's fascinating, detailed, part-historical work
and represents, I think, one of the most important skills in the
history of librarianship.
