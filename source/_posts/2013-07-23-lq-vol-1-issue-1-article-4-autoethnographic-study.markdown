This entry is about:

Waples, Douglas. (1931). The Graduate Library School at Chicago.
*The Library Quarterly, 1*(1), 26-36.

**Note:** The fourth article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "The Graduate Library School at Chicago." It was written
by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with: 

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** The purpose of the article is to explain the Graduate
Library School (GLS) at Chicago. The motivation is based on the
relationship between GLS and the *LQ*. The author writes that
since the editing of the journal "will likely fall upon the staff"
(p. 26) of the GLS, then an understanding of GLS and its policies
should be provided. The first footnote indicates that it was first
delivered to the Association of American Library Schools in 1929,
which, I should add, is presently known as the [Association of
Library and Information Science Education][1].

**Note:** The article outlines nine policy statements about the
School. Notably, the School is meant to push research and not to
train future librarians.

**Note:** Since GLS is primarily interested in producing library
science doctorates, the School represents, at the time, a new
model of library education. The question is, when did Schools
begin to merge this model with models related to library
education, such that they produce both doctorates headed for
research and instruction and Masters headed for librarianship?

**Note:** As [C. C. Williamson][2] does, Waples refers, in a
section titled "What is a Library Science?", to John Dewey's *The
Sources of a Science of Education.*

Of this piece, Waples write:

> No writing has appeared to date which in short space so
> helpfully presents a philosophy of research in the social
> studies (p. 30).

An interesting quote about this:

> I take it no one has to argue any longer the fact that
> librarianship *is* primarily a social enterprise; that only in
> so far as we know what human needs are responsive to reading can
> we furnish the best reading in the best way; that to this major
> problem the difficulties met in administering library routine as
> at present organized are altogether subordinate; and that what
> the librarian can ultimately contribute to the advance of
> scholarship and hence to the welfare of society depends entirely
> upon his ability to select from all fields of knowledge whatever
> helps to reveal and satisfy the needs that reading can meet (p.
> 30).

**Note:** Related to "all fields of knowledge," Waples writes
that:

> We are just beginning at Chicago to find out what elements of
> other University departments and disciplines pertain to library
> problems. The extent of such application is obviously great, far
> greater than we can ever hope to evaluate precisely. But various
> other fields of study have already been identified as capable of
> yielding laws, facts, and methods of investigation from which a
> genuine science of librarianship may evolve (pp. 33-34).

The fields include:

- bibliography
- education
- history
- law
- literary criticism
- philosophy
- political science
- psychology
- social service administration
- sociology
- statistics (p. 34).

**Note:** The final section of the article functions as an
appendix (although not labeled as such) and outlines the topics
that were being investigated at GLS during its first two years
(1928--1930). In large part, and aside from the wording of the
descriptions, many of the topics under investigation read as if
they could be present day topics under investigation.

**Reflection:** I don't have much to say about this piece, within
the context of my current project, but I have a hunch that I will
need to refer to it again later. At this point, the article's
presence in *LQ* signifies the general introductory nature of this
first issue. Given the message about research at GLS, I still find
it interesting that the first issue was not populated with
research articles, and I keep thinking that that is important.
Since the list of topics under investigation, at GLS, is about two
pages long, it seems that it could have been populated so.
Perhaps, and as I commented in my [last post][3], since *LQ* is
the first research journal for the field, the introductory nature
of this issue is more important than simply thrusting out research
articles. That says to me something about the historical
importance of this journal (and others) and its role in forming
the identity of our field of study. Again, I refer to my
[abstract][4] for what I mean by that.

**Note:** As I was reviewing my notes, and re-read the line that
follows, something occurred to me:

> the librarian can ultimately contribute to the advance of
> scholarship and hence to the welfare of society

If this piece had been written today, I'm fairly sure that the
word "libraries" would have been used instead of the word
"librarian." So the above line, and others like it, if written
today, I imagine, would have read like so:

> *libraries* can ultimately contribute to the advance of
> scholarship and hence to the welfare of society

Plutchak has written on this tendency to substitute (see reference
below) librarians for libraries. I have a conference presentation
on this too (see reference below).

[Abstract](http://www.alise.org/assets/documents/juried%20papers%20abstract.pdf)

The latter piece is related to this ongoing work:

[/blog/2013/06/13/collective-responsibility-ethics-paper/](/blog/2013/06/13/collective-responsibility-ethics-paper/)

So, I will incorporate this into our ethics research project. The
question to incorporate is: when did the field begin assigning
agency, responsibility, praise, action, and so forth to
**libraries** instead of to **librarians**. Of course, one article
does not make a trend, but I'm curious if there is something to
this. (How I'd incorporate that into an ethics research project
means changing the ethics research project a bit. Which is fine
because that project is a bit stalled and needs something.)
