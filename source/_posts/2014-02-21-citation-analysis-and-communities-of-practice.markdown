**Preface:**

This semester I am teaching a knowledge management (KM) course. I
will be posting entries throughout the semester that describe,
critique, summarize, outline, etc. KM articles that my students
are not reading. The purpose here is to leverage the amount of
material I can expose them to.

**Article under discussion:**

This post is about:

Tight, Malcolm. (2008). Higher education research as tribe,
territory and/or community: A co-ciation analysis. *Higher
Education, 55*(5), 593-605.
doi:[10.1007/s10734-007-9077-1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10734-007-9077-1)

The article was picked by searching the Library and Information
Science &amp; Technology Abstracts (LISTA) database, beginning
with a thesaurus search for *knowledge management* and choosing
*communities of practice* as a *related term*.

**Notes and discussion:**

The article uses [co-citation analysis][1] to explore and map the
relationships among academics under the theory that such academics
function as communities of practice and also as tribes in their
territories. Each concept has similar but different meanings and
implications. The author asks questions that highlight these
differences:

> So, we may ask, if higher education research is conceived of as
> a territory (though, I would argue, not necessarily a
> discipline), what tribe or tribes occupy it? Or, alternatively,
> and as well, do higher education researchers share a sense of
> joint enterprise, enjoy norms and relationships of mutuality (in
> contrast to Becher's conclusion), and have a shared repertoire
> of communal resources, such as to qualify them for
> identification as a community of practice (Tight, 2008, p. 596).

In order to explore these concepts, the author analyzes the
references in a sample of 406 articles about higher education and
that were published in non-American English language journals. In
using co-citation analysis, examining the degree to which *n*
number of articles cite two or more other articles, it seems the
author hopes to map out tribes or communities of practice. For
example,

> the two most cited authors [in these 406 articles] do not appear

> research and writing interets within the field of higher
> education (Tight, 2008, p. 602).

In short, because other higher education researchers do not seem
to be frequently citing both Clark and Ramsden in the same
articles, it's not likely that they each research similar issues
within higher education. Ergo, Clark and Ramsden operate in
different tribes and occupy different territories, at least at a
particular point in time.

There are a number of ways to explore communities of practice, and
while the *best* ways may involve detailed, in-depth, and highly
descriptive approaches (e.g., ethnography akin to the [Hara][2]
piece we're reading in class), this article highlights how a
quantitative approach (co-citation analysis) can offer both a
birds eye view of these communities and also direct us to where
such communities exist when the existence of those communities may
not be so apparent (e.g., researchers working in different
geographic locations versus lawyers working in a particular firm).
The same approach could be (and has been) applied to an analysis
of hyperlinks.
