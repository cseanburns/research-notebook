Some of my *PeerJ* research will be discussed as part of a panel
next week at [ASIS&amp;T](http://asis.org/asist2013/). Although my
presentation is about a broader issue, I will use the *PeerJ*
research to frame some discussion questions.

Below is a draft of my slides (written in Markdown to be converted
to HTML slides with Pandoc). I will continue to revise this post
until it is complete and a final draft emerges.

## Examining Peer Review

### Science and communication

Scientific knowledge rests on the communication of science

> Science \[is\] conceived of as a system of communication" (p. 447).

Robert K. Merton, (1973), *The Matthew Effect in Science*

## Examining Peer Review

### Science and communication

> Knowledge is not simply made of the stuff that happened in the
> laboratory, or what was found in the archive, or what transpired
> in social observation. Rather, it is what a scholar tells us has
> happened or was found or transpired (Cope &amp; Kalantzis,
> Breaking point 2 sect., 2009).

## Examining Peer Review

### Science and communication: Assumptions

"Communism" or the idea that "the substantive findings of science
are product of social collaboration and are assigned to the
community" (p. 273), Robert K. Merton, "The Normative Structure of
Science."

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption

The most pertinent from Cope and Kalantzis (2009):

* technological affordances
* economics and expectations of free access
* distributed knowledge-making
* knowledge-producing, symbol-making, participatory cultures

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption: Technological affordances

> At most, the technological opens out social affordances,
> frequently in ways not anticipated by the designers of those
> technologies. So what is the range of affordances in digital
> technologies that open new possibilities for knowledge making
> (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, E1 sect., 2009)? 

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption: Economics and expectations of free access 

> "So, at those times today when we reach a journal article on the
> Internet to which we don’t have subscription access and it costs
> US$30 or US$50, this breaks the norm of information socialism to
> which we have now become accustomed" (Cope & Kalantzis, E2
> sect., 2009).

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption: Distributed knowledge-making

>  "Universities and conventional research institutes today face
>  significant challenges to their historical role as producers of
>  socially privileged knowledge ....  In these places, the logics
>  and logistics of knowledge production are disruptive of the
>  traditional values of the scholarly work — [e.g.,] ... the
>  'wisdom of the crowd' which ranks knowledge and makes it
>  discoverable through the Internet according to its popularity.
>  If one wanted to view these developments normatively, one could
>  perhaps describe them as amounting to a democratization of
>  knowledge. Or we could simply leave this an empirical
>  observation: knowledge is being made in more widely dispersed
>  institutional sites (Cope & Kalantzis, E3 sect., 2009).

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption: Knowledge-producing, symbol-making, and participatory cultures

> The historical dichotomy of author and reader, creator and
> consumer, is everywhere being blurred .... What will academic
> journals be like when they escape their heritage constraints?
> There will be more knowledge collaborations between knowledge
> creators and knowledge users, in which user commentary perhaps
> can become part of the knowledge itself. Knowledge making will
> escape its linear, lock–step, beginning–to–end process. The end
> point will not be a singular version of record — it will be
> something that can be re–versioned as much as needed. Knowledge
> making will be more recursive, responsive, dynamic and above
> all, more collaborative and social than it was in an earlier
> modernity that payed greater obeisance to the voice of the
> heroically original author (Cope & Kalantzis, E6 sect., 2009).

## Examining Peer Review

### Epistemic disruption: Traditional peer review

In the traditional peer review process, there are these problems:

> In each of these respects, the peer review process is less than
> ideal as a discursive framework. There are power asymmetries,
> identities are not revealed, dialogue between referee and author
> is prevented, the arbiter–editor is unaccountable, consensus is
> not necessarily reached, and none of these processes are open to
> scrutiny on the public record" (C & K, P1 sect., 2009).

Regarding power asymmetry, see also: Lipworth and Kerridge, (2011)

## Examining Peer Review

### Aesthetic disruption: The Referee

According to Merton's examination, scientists at least had placed
great emphasis on the referee system:

> "The referee is the lynchpin about which the whole business of
> Science is pivoted" (p. 461).

And did not simply act in accordance with knowledge-creation
criteria, but also acted in accordance to taste:

> The "editors and referees of scientific journals" act as "the
> main defenders of scientific 'good taste'" (p. 461).

## Examining Peer Review

### Aesthetic disruption: Taste and judgment 

> Almost invariably they \[outstanding scientists\] lay great
> emphasis on the importance of problem-*finding*, not only
> problem-solving. They uniformly express the strong conviction
> that what matters most in their work is a developing sense of
> taste, of judgment, in seizing upon problems that are of
> fundamental importance (Merton, p. 453, 1973).

## Enter *PeerJ*

### Aesthetic disruption: Soundness, not Taste and judgment 

> PeerJ evaluates articles based only on an objective
> determination of scientific and methodological soundness, not on
> subjective determinations of 'impact,' 'novelty' or 'interest'
> ([https://peerj.com/about/aims-and-scope/](https://peerj.com/about/aims-and-scope/)). 

And:

> Rigorous yet fair review. Judge the **soundness** of the
> science, not its importance \[emphasis added\]
> ([https://peerj.com/about/editorial-criteria/](https://peerj.com/about/editorial-criteria/)).

## Examining Peer Review

### Open peer review: A social constructivist move?

*PeerJ* allows for open peer review. Peer review history is
optionally made available. Reveals a discourse between editors,
referees, and authors.

> The followers of social constructivism contradict this
> assumption \[the intellectual ownership assumption\]. To them,
> it is not only the author that is responsible for the content of
> a manuscript (and has rights to the intellectual property); the
> content of a manuscript is a joint product by the author,
> reviewer, and editor (Bornmann, p. 31, 2008).

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis

*RQ-1:* Does the peer review process in *PeerJ* align or deviate
from the normative view of science?

*RQ-2:* Do *PeerJ* referees and editors judge submissions by
aesthetic qualities?

* Content analysis
* Random sampling, July 20, 2013
* Population 107 articles
* Sample size: 30
* Resampled with replacement, add the difference to the previous
  sample
* New sample size: 33
* Collected peer review histories
* Agents include: authors, referees (~2 per article), and academic
  editors
* Texts include: referee comments, academic editor comments,
  author rebuttals

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis

For 33 peer review histories:

*   83 referee comments

    *   70 comments after first round reviews
    *   13 comments after second round reviews

*   43 author rebuttals

    *   29 first round author rebuttals
    *   14 second round author rebuttals

*   77 Academic editor comments

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis

Content analysis based on contrast coding.

Coding *a priori*. Dictionary of codes derived from WordNet lexical database.

Example usage. First command searches for synonyms of *soundness*.
Second command searches for adjectives of *true*:

    wordnet soundness -synsn
    wordnet true -synsa

Codes fit within one of the following categories, or concepts:

* Epistemic disruption. Terms related to soundness, scientific
  rigor, objective criteria.
* Aesthetic disruption. Terms related to aesthetics or taste:
  i.e., impact, novelty, interest, etc. 

Categories and codes entered into
[RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/).

Each file (referee comment, academic editor comment, author
rebuttal) first coded for aesthetic terms and then coded for
epistemic terms.

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis: Epistemic disruption

Terms related to *soundness*, based on WordNet:

* firmness, strength

Terms related to *validity*:

* cogent, rigor, credible, believable

Terms related to *fact*:

* information, concept

Terms related to *true*:

* accurate, typical, reliable, legitimate

Terms related to *rigorous*:

* strict, stringent, exact

Terms related to *criteria*:

* standard, measure 

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis: Aesthetic disruption

Terms related to *taste*:

* preference, predilection, penchant, appreciation, discernment,
perceptiveness, discrimination, experience

Terms related to *impact*:

* striking, influence

Terms related to *novelty*:

* original

Terms related to *original*:

* model, example

Terms related to *interesting*:

* intriguing

Terms related to *intriguing*:

* challenging, provocative

Terms related to *provocative*:

* ambitious, stimulating

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis: Findings

Analysis in process.

| Concept   | # of Codings | # of Files |
| --------  |:------------:| ----------:|
| Aesthetic | 42 Codings   | 12 Files   |
| Epistemic | 74 Codings   | 14 Files   |

## Examining Peer Review

### *PeerJ* analysis: Questions

* Should the aesthetic be a part of the peer review process?
* If so, should the process include criteria related to
  originality, novelty, influence, taste?
