Some of my *PeerJ* research will be discussed as part of a panel
next week at [ASIS&amp;T](http://asis.org/asist2013/). Although my
presentation is about a broader issue, I will use the *PeerJ*
research to frame some discussion questions.

Below are <del>is a draft of</del> my slides (written in Markdown and converted
to HTML slides with Pandoc). 

Forward note: John Budd made a remark at the beginning of the
panel that the word *Deciding* really should have been something
like *Investigating*. This is true. We are not the deciders.

## Science and communication

Scientific knowledge rests on the communication of science:

> Science \[is\] conceived of as a system of communication (p. 447).

Robert K. Merton, (1973), *The Matthew Effect in Science*

> Knowledge is not simply made of the stuff that happened in the
> laboratory, or what was found in the archive, or what transpired
> in social observation. Rather, it is what a scholar tells us has
> happened or was found or transpired (Cope &amp; Kalantzis,
> Breaking point 2 sect., 2009).

## Science and communication: Assumption

**Communism** or the idea that:

> the substantive findings of science are a product of social
> collaboration and are assigned to the community (p. 273).

-- Robert K. Merton, (1973), *The Normative Structure of Science*

## Epistemic disruption

Enter the social, collaborative web and epistemic disruption:

From Cope and Kalantzis (2009):

* technological affordances
* economics and expectations of free access
* distributed knowledge-making
* knowledge-producing, symbol-making, participatory cultures

## Epistemic disruption: Technological affordances

The social web either affords new scholarly behavior or affords
new ways to document pre-existing scholarly behavior:

> At most, the technological opens out social affordances,
> frequently in ways not anticipated by the designers of those
> technologies. So what is the range of affordances in digital
> technologies that open new possibilities for knowledge making
> (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, E1 sect., 2009)? 

## Epistemic disruption: Economics and expectations of free access 

The web fosters expectations of free and open access:

> So, at those times today when we reach a journal article on the
> Internet to which we don't have subscription access and it costs
> US$30 or US$50, this breaks the norm of information socialism to
> which we have now become accustomed (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, E2
> sect., 2009).

## Epistemic disruption: Distributed knowledge-making

The social web reveals and documents a variety of knowledge-making
participants and ranks the value of that knowledge by its
popularity:

>  "Universities and conventional research institutes today face
>  significant challenges to their historical role as producers of
>  socially privileged knowledge ....  In these places, the logics
>  and logistics of knowledge production are disruptive of the
>  traditional values of the scholarly work — [e.g.,] ... the
>  **'wisdom of the crowd'** which ranks knowledge and makes it
>  discoverable through the Internet according to its popularity.
>  If one wanted to view these developments normatively, one could
>  perhaps describe them as amounting to a democratization of
>  knowledge. Or we could simply leave this an empirical
>  observation: knowledge is being made in more widely dispersed
>  institutional sites \[emphasis added\] (Cope &amp; Kalantzis,
>  E3 sect., 2009).

## Epistemic disruption: Knowledge-producing, symbol-making, and participatory cultures

The social web alters or de-linearizes knowledge structures:

> The historical dichotomy of author and reader, creator and
> consumer, is everywhere being blurred .... What will academic
> journals be like when they escape their heritage constraints?
> There will be more knowledge collaborations between knowledge
> creators and knowledge users, in which user commentary perhaps
> can become part of the knowledge itself. Knowledge making will
> escape its linear, lock–step, beginning–to–end process. The end
> point will not be a singular version of record — it will be
> something that can be re–versioned as much as needed. Knowledge
> making will be more recursive, responsive, dynamic and above
> all, more collaborative and social than it was in an earlier
> modernity that payed greater obeisance to the voice of the
> heroically original author (Cope &amp; Kalantzis, E6 sect.,
> 2009).

## Traditional peer review

In the traditional peer review process, it is argued that there
are these problems:

> In each of these respects, the peer review process is less than
> ideal as a discursive framework. There are power asymmetries,
> identities are not revealed, dialogue between referee and author
> is prevented, the arbiter–editor is unaccountable, consensus is
> not necessarily reached, and none of these processes are open to
> scrutiny on the public record" (C &amp; K, P1 sect., 2009).

<sub>Regarding power asymmetry, see also: Lipworth and Kerridge
(2011)</sub>

<sub>Regarding consensus, see also: Lee, Sugimoto, Zhang, and
Cronin (2013)</sub>

## Aesthetic disruption: The Referee

And then, there is the *aesthetic disruption*:

As Robert K. Merton noted, scientists place great importance
on the referee system:

> "The referee is the lynchpin about which the whole business of
> Science is pivoted" (p. 461).

And the referee does not simply act in accordance with
knowledge-creation criteria but also acts in accordance to
taste:

> The "editors and referees of scientific journals" act as "the
> main defenders of scientific **'good taste'**" \[emphasis
> added\] (p. 461).

For example, as cited in Lee, Sugimoto, Zhang, and Cronin (2013),
even in various experiments with peer review, the aesthetic
remains:

> The goal of the [peer-review] procedure is to "give constructive
> feedback to the authors and/or to **prevent publication of
> uninteresting** or fatally flawed articles (*Journal of Medical
> Internet Research, 2012*)" \[emphasis added\] (p. 12).

## Aesthetic disruption: Taste and judgment 

The relationship between scientific taste and great science:

> Almost invariably they \[outstanding scientists\] lay great
> emphasis on the importance of problem-*finding*, not only
> problem-solving. They uniformly express the strong conviction
> that what matters most in their work is a developing sense of
> taste, of judgment, in seizing upon problems that are of
> fundamental importance (Merton, p. 453, 1973).

*Taste* may be, arguably, framed in another way. For example, in
Bornmann, Weymuth, and Daniel (2010), the criteria examined in
their study is referred to as: *Relevance of contribution*.
Referee comments include:

> "A stunning paper with outstanding results ...", "... very
> important and challenging topic ...", "... very nice result that
> fills the gap in the knowledge of ..." ... (Bornmann, et al., p.
> 498, 2010).

## Aesthetic disruption: *PeerJ*, soundness, not taste and judgment 
Enter *PeerJ*.

A publication that casts off the aesthetic:

> *PeerJ* evaluates articles based only on an objective
> determination of scientific and methodological soundness, not on
> subjective determinations of 'impact,' 'novelty' or 'interest'
> ([https://peerj.com/about/aims-and-scope/](https://peerj.com/about/aims-and-scope/)). 

And:

> Rigorous yet fair review. Judge the **soundness** of the
> science, **not its importance** \[emphasis added\]
> ([https://peerj.com/about/editorial-criteria/](https://peerj.com/about/editorial-criteria/)).

![Soundness not importance](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55752964/octopress/editorialCriteria.png "Soundness not importance")

## Open peer review: A social constructivist move?

*PeerJ* allows for open peer review. Peer review history is
optionally made available. Reveals a discourse between editors,
referees, and authors.

> The followers of social constructivism contradict this
> assumption \[the intellectual ownership assumption\]. To them,
> it is not only the author that is responsible for the content of
> a manuscript (and has rights to the intellectual property); the
> content of a manuscript is a joint product by the author,
> reviewer, and editor (Bornmann, p. 31, 2008).

## *PeerJ* analysis: Questions, data

*RQ-1:* Does the peer review process in *PeerJ* align or deviate
from the normative view of science?

*RQ-2:* Do *PeerJ* referees and editors judge submissions by
aesthetic qualities?

* Content analysis
* Random sampling, July 20, 2013
* Population 107 articles
* Sample size: 30
* Re-sampled with replacement, add the difference to the previous
  sample
* New sample size: 33
* Collected peer review histories
* Agents include: authors, referees (~2 per article), and academic
  editors
* Texts include: referee comments, academic editor comments,
  author rebuttals

## *PeerJ* analysis, Data

For 33 peer review histories:

*   83 referee comments

    *   70 comments after first round reviews
    *   13 comments after second round reviews

*   43 author rebuttals

    *   29 first round author rebuttals
    *   14 second round author rebuttals

*   77 Academic editor comments

## *PeerJ* analysis, content analysis

Coding *a priori*. Dictionary of codes derived from WordNet lexical database.

Codes fit within one of the following categories, or concepts:

* **Epistemic disruption**. Terms related to soundness, scientific
  rigor, objective criteria.
* **Aesthetic disruption**. Terms related to aesthetics or taste:
  i.e., impact, novelty, interest, etc. 

Categories and codes entered into
[RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/).

## *PeerJ* analysis: Some examples

* 01-R2-1: "It represents an important intellectual contribution
  to the field"
* 02-R1-1: "This work represents an important contribution to the
  field that is expected to have a noticeable impact"
* 03-R2-1: "fundamental in the field"
* 105-R2-1: "The aim of the manuscript is relevant and timely"

Some variant of *interesting* is used:

* 58 times in 40 referee comments (~ 479 words per comment)
* 11 times in 10 editor comments (~ 119 words per comment)

## *PeerJ*: Discussion

What I am wondering is happening here is not that some in the
scientific community (e.g., the users and founders of *PeerJ*) are
giving up on the aesthetic. Rather, are they crowd sourcing it
with the use of article level metrics and altmetrics, so that, the
aesthetic is no longer applied by the referee as gatekeeper?
Instead, it is applied, if at all, by the community?

## *PeerJ*: Discussion, example

![Article Level Metrics and Altmetrics](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55752964/octopress/almMetrics.png "Article Level Metrics and Altmetrics")

Source: [https://peerj.com/articles/175/](https://peerj.com/articles/175/)

## *PeerJ*: Discussion

In practice, *PeerJ* will possibly publish **uninteresting** (to
the relevant people) science. 

The old way?

> The areas "Relevance of contribution" and "Writing/Presentation"
> appear, however, to play an important role not only in the AC-IE
> peer review, but also in other peer review processes (Bornmann,
> Weymuth, &amp; Daniels, p. 502, 2010).

## *PeerJ* analysis: Discussion questions

* Should the aesthetic be a part of the peer review process?
* Or, should the aesthetic be crowd sourced?
* Or, has the scientific community, writ large, become more about
  problem-solving rather than problem-finding. Has the community
made a master of the methods?
* Or, is something scientific if it is uninteresting (to the
  relevant communities as the relevant time)?
* Or, is a publication, such as *PeerJ*, not aiming to be a
  high-impact journal -- not advancing science, just publishing
it?

## *PeerJ* analysis: Discussion questions

The higher order information science concept:

* What criteria affect the dissemination of authenticated
  scientific information?

Shall we change this to:

* What criteria affect the dissemination of information to be
  later authenticated as scientific by crowd sourcing?
