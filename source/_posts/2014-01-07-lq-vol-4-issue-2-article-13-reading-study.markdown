**Note:** The thirteenth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Reorganization of
the Library of a Small College."

It was written by Karl T. Jacobsen, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Luther College

**Note:** Presents an image of a small college library.
Historically important for that alone. Important aspect: when the
librarian was hired in 1920, it seems he was given full faculty
status. See page 236, end of 2nd paragraph, for the sentence.

**Note:** The author, as a librarian, had to reclassify and
re-catalog the collection. Used LC. Students' appreciation of the
library apparently increased as a result of the reorganization and
more used the library and more became interested in librarianship.

Good example of the relationship between how the library is
presented to patrons and how often the patrons use the library.

**Note:** Information-literacy by any other name. On library
instruction:

> For the freshman, two lectures by the college librarian as a
> part of the college orientation course have been followed by a
> practice period in groups of twenty-five or less. This year an
> attempt is being made to supplement this procedure by
> co-operation with the course in freshman English (p. 240).

Detailed account of library instruction follows the above
paragraph. For example:

> This has resulted in what virtually amounts to individual
> tutoring by the librarian of the more than 125 freshman. The
> topics assigned, all biographical, have been such that to find
> the material available the students have had to make use of the
> various tools of the library, particularly the catalog and
> periodical indexes and a considerable number of reference books,
> both general and those connected more closely with the specific
> topic of the student. In each case the student was required to
> look up all the material he could find in the library on his
> topic and---except in a few instances where the material was
> very extensive and a selection had to be made---to record these
> references in accurate bibliographic form (pp. 240-241).

The librarian graded the above work and that grade was used by the
English professor as part of the final grade. Collaboration.

**Note:** Expense details on page 242. And circulation details on
page 243.
