**Note:** The third article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Goethe the Librarian."

It was written by Charles F. Gosnell and Géza Schütz,
who were affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** New York City (No affiliation)

**Note:** More

More discussion about Goethe and what may be considered
the problem with the glut of information and managing
that glut. There was early interest in a union catalog,
although that term is not used. Instead, the German term
"'Gesamt-Catalog'" is used and other phrases including
the "'Real-Catalog'" and the "'Nominal-Catalog'" (p.
369). Essentially, the desire to unionize collections,
either physically or indexically, has existed for quite
some time.

**Note:** The number of social science articles in these
early volumes of *LQ* are interesting especially in
comparison to the number of historical / humanities
articles.

**Note:** Incredible story related by Goethe on pages
371-372.

**Note:** The author summarizes Goethe's
accomplishments:

> After two years of work, in December, 1819, Goethe was
> able to look back with satisfaction on the work
> accomplished and report what he had done. A veritable
> revolution had taken place. The several rooms that
> held the library had been joined by doorways,
> partitions and screens had been fixed, numerous
> repairs effected, and painting done; and, of course, a
> wall had been razed and a garden improved, and a door
> had been cut into a room once used by the medical
> faculty. In the library proper, an accession book had
> been started, a new "Ausleihebuch" or loan-book had
> been introduced, a name-catalogue on slips was in the
> making, classification had been carried through the
> pure and applied sciences and was progressing in other
> fields, and many other reforms were being made. In
> November, 1824, after seven years of work, Goethe, at
> the age of seventy-five, was able to report that his
> task had been completed (p. 373).

**Note:** Goethe's fascination with the loan-book. See
top of page 374.

**Note:** Of course I've read Goethe, but I had no idea,
given these two articles on him, about his relationship
and work with libraries. Really quite fascinating. Needs
more exploration.
