**Note:** The third article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "
Libraries and Cultural Renaissance."

It was written by A. K. Borden, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Pennsylvania

**Note:** Borden's third *LQ* article. The first one
(quote a few times so far in *LQ*) is [The Sociological
Beginnings of the Library Movement][1]. The second one,
also historical, is [Seventeenth-Century American
Libraries][2]. This article is also historical (dealing
with cultural revolutions in early England, France, and
Italy and the causal necessity of books and libraries),
and it's essential thesis is nicely summarized in the
last sentence:

> Where and when the love of knowledge will blaze forth
> with renaissance proportions, no one knows, but the
> genius of the past will doubtless smile first on that
> place which has been busy storing its treasures (p.
> 35).
