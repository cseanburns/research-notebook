**Note:** The second article of the third issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Buch
und Bibliotheken unter der Perspektive Goethe / Goethe's
Attitude toward Books and Libraries."

It was written by Richard Oehler, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Universitätsbibliothek Frankfurt am Main
/ Frankfurt University Library

**Note:** The article is published in both German and
English -- alternating pages between each language.
Interestingly, and I don't know if this is common
practice when journals do this, the page numbers are
continuous despite the breaks in language.

**Reflection:** I wouldn't have guessed that I'd be
reading about Nietzsche, Shopenhauer, and Goethe in a
library science journal.

**Reflection:** I think one reason why I keep returning
to the idea that the people of this era's experience is
not much different than ours, and that their questions
are not much different than ours, is because their
experience of their own information explosion is quite
similar to our own experience of information explosion.
While their experience may have been a [physical
one](/blog/2013/09/11/lq-vol-1-issue-3-article-1-reading-study/)
one, and ours a digital one, it seems qualitatively the
same in many ways. In fact, our experience seems
entailed by theirs -- not necessarily an inevitable
outcome but a highly likely one.

> One characteristic seems to distinguish our age from
> all that has gone before; this is our vivid personal
> interest and deep-seated intellectual curiosity in
> everything, men and objects, outside of ourselves (p.
> 233).

Then:

> We strive to comprehend concrete reality and we
> reproduce more often than we create. This is the
> source of our superabundance of factual literature
> that endeavors to include the least detail. We are,
> above all else, men who have read and have written
> excessively (p. 233).

**Note:** The book and the self; the book and
universalism. One of the most important statements on
reading that I have seen in our literature:

> The book is one of the most important and---let us say
> it frankly---one of the most baneful links between our
> intellectual and spiritual lives and those of other
> men of the present and past. Without the book we
> cannot get out of ourselves or back into what has gone
> before. A Crusoe ideal of life would be madness. That
> is why we live with books and value them as our very
> lives. We must thus value them, and yet we constantly
> strive against them, for they carry a threat to "snuff
> out the vital spark of independent thought" (p. 237).

**Note:** Doing and reading:

> To Goethe action and reality are everything. "In the
> beginning was the deed." He finds it impossible to
> grant equal value and dignity to the word, which is
> written and read. And today, a century and a half
> later, that is still the best description of the
> disharmony of our inner spiritual life, real
> accomplishments versus literary production. Actual
> deeds, on the one hand; the book, on the other---real
> life or the book---present the same problem to us
> today as they did to Goethe (p. 239).

**Note:** Powerful stuff:

> Goethe battled against excessive writing and excessive
> reading, much as Shopenhauer and Nietzsche did later,
> and as much as the Old Testament preacher, thousands
> of years before Goethe, with his plaint: "And
> furthermore, my son, be admonished, of making many
> books there is no end." Goethe, before all of his
> contemporaries, foresaw prophetically the coming mass
> production of books" (p. 243).

And then he quotes two passages from Goethe, one on the
production of books and writings and the other on
"voracious reader", which sounds like a description of
present-day times and the madness of production (e.g.,
blogs):

> And about the voracious reader:

>> Nowadays everybody reads, and many readers run
>> through a book precipitately, and then take pen in
>> hand themselves to propagate with remarkable facility
>> a book of their own from the book just read! "Do you
>> want me, my friend, to write about other literary
>> productions, and thereby increase the existing mass
>> of writing? Shall I thus spread my views, to afford
>> others an opportunity to proclaim **their** views
>> about **my** views, and thus keep in action the
>> swaying of the groaning scales?" (p. 243).

**Note:** See my notes about the theme of
decentralization, which seems to be a result, as I'm
coming to believe, of the increased result of the
production of information:

> Possibly the almost insurmountable problems of space
> in the metropolitan libraries of the future could be
> anticipated through the following steps. Goethe
> disclaimed a desire to consolidate physically the
> libraries of several cities, though they were close to
> one another. One might easily conceive a plan to
> protect the metropolitan libraries of the future from
> making accessions to the limit of possibility by
> establishing special reserve stocks at certain points
> and thereby relieving the burden of the central
> libraries. In that way one would, to a certain extent,
> curb the tendency to a physical concentration in one
> place, as is now the case. This thought can only be
> suggested here. In actual experience its
> practicability will be increased more and more with
> the amplification and multiplication and cheapening
> of the means of transportation from city to city, from
> country to country, and across the seas (p. 247).

**Note:** And we are simply carrying out the work that
our predecessors began:

> After all, what we are concerned with is "virtual
> consolidation"--we always go back to Goethe--i.e., the
> possibility of encompassing the material in libraries
> by means of catalogues, and, at the same time, of
> making the deposits accessible and useful, whether in
> the local library or elsewhere (pp. 247-249).

And:

> Thus throughout the world an active effort is actually
> being made to master, by means of bibliographic
> organization, the flood of scholarly publications. At
> the time time this method will serve future
> generations, as an organization of scholarship itself
> (p. 249).
