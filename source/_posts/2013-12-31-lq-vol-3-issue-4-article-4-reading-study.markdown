**Note:** The fourth article of the fourth issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Proposals Submitted
to the American Library Association for Study and Investigation."

It was written by Charles H. Brown, Carleton B. Joeckel, Ralph
Munn, C. C. Williamson, and Louis R. Wilson, who were affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Advisory Board for the Study of Special Projects

**Note:** ALA establishes a committee to help determine priority
and coverage of research fronts in librarianship. The authors,
serving on this committee, take into consideration a list of
proposals that have been submitted to ALA in the previous years by
various members and other entities. The committee categorizes,
ranks, and charts the progress these areas of research.

One of the stated purposes of this study reflects the nature of
our field and its complexity, but also something about science in
general:

> Publication of this report in the present form is primarily
> intended to serve two closely related purposes. The first is to
> draw a clear distinction between service studies, which are
> often best undertaken locally in terms of actual conditions that
> render the problem acute, and research of genuine theoretical
> value to the profession at large (p. 391).

This purpose mirrors the scientific enterprise in the following
way:

1. Some studies seek to add factual knowledge about the world or
   the state of affairs
1. Some studies seek to test theory (or higher order concepts)

**Note:** This is an important report as it lays out what the
authors and the field, in general, have in mind in regards to the
values held by the field and its domain. It highlights what
research has been completed on certain topics, where research
needs to direct its attention, etc.

The general outline of the research is:

I. Readers and reading  
II. Reading matter, publications  
III. Administration of distributing agencies  

Those three top level topics are too broad to illuminate the
all the details.
