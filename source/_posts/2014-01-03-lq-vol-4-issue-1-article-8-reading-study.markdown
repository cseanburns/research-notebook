**Note:** The eighth article of the first issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Richard Rogers
Bowker: September 4, 1848-November 12, 1933."

It was written by Louis R. Wilson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** A respectful obituary of Richard Rogers Bowker, one of
the founders of the American Library Association and the *Library
Journal*.

**Note:** It should be noted that Bowker (and many in the
profession) were not a fan of *LQ* at the beginning. See my notes
on Steve Norman's (1988) article on the early years of *LQ*.
