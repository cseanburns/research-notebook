Joeckel, Carleton B. (1931). The Public Library under the
City-Manager Form of Government. *The Library Quarterly, 1*(2),

**Note:** The first article of the second issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "The Public Library under the City-Manager
Form of Government" It was written by Carleton B. Joeckel, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan

**Note:** A powerful introduction set within the context of why
libraries do not receive much attention, much financial support
from their municipal governments, and little pay for their
librarians:

> Moreover, notwithstanding the best publicity efforts of modern
> librarians, the library has never been a spectacular feature of
> government. The basis of its success consists of thousands of
> individual units of service to its many users. It cannot point
> with pride to single outstanding achievements, such as the
> construction of a new street or a new bridge, the capture of a
> notorious criminal, or the extinguishing of a dangerous fire
> (pp. 121--122).

**Note:** Two lines of public library development:

- public libraries attached to school districts
- public libraries attached to city governments

Then the notion of the board of library trustees is introduced.
Such that:

> So firmly has the board idea intrenched [*sic*] itself in
> library administration that librarians themselves have come to
> regard it almost as a sacred and inalienable right, variation
> from which is unthinkable and not to be tolerated. Scant space
> is given in writings by librarians to other forms of library
> government; and the librarian has come, pretty generally, to
> accept the *sui generis* idea of the library's place in
> municipal affairs. The librarian still feels that the library's
> place *is* different and distinct from all other parts of the
> municipal government and, as such, is entitled to special and
> separate consideration at all times. He often fails to realize
> that the board plan was but one phase of the development of
> municipal administration and that library organization took
> shape as it did largely because of the existing fashion
> prevalent at the moment in municipal government rather than from
> any special design (pp. 123--124).

- public libraries in the "council-manager government" (p. 125)

**Note:** This is likely the first research article to appear in
this journal, as we would understand that concept / construct
today. That said, it differs from the form presented today, even
though only superficially. That is, there are no literal
Introduction, Literature Review, Findings, Discussion, etc.
sections marked off, but the article naturally follows that kind
of organization, even though its sectioned off differently.
Personally, I like it.

**Note:** Joeckel finds five types of public library management
with each type containing finer grain categories (quoted in bits):

> 1. School library districts
> 2. Municipal public libraries with independent library boards
> 3. "Corporation" libraries with self-perpetuating boards
> 4. Libraries managed by non-governmental associations
> 5. Municipal public libraries under the control of city manager
   (pp. 128--129).

**Note:** After laying out his classification of the legal
organization of these public libraries, Joeckel proceeds to
describe each type and provide examples from the various cities he
examined. 

**Note:** The final two appendices are extremely helpful. The
first appendix lays out his findings in tabular form. The second
in charts and diagrams.

**Note:** The article ends with a note that a second part will be
issued in July.

**Note:** This article would benefit a variety of courses in a LIS
program:

- management of libraries
- history of libraries
- ethical issues in libraries (as the control of various parts of
  the library will have an effect on what librarians can do at any
  specific library. For example, whether they can purchase books).

I've heard a few people raise the idea that there should be more
integration between LIS programs (especially lines in the LIS
programs that focus on public libraries) and political science
programs. This article is evidence that such a relationship would
be fruitful.

**Note**: There's a nice Wikipedia article on [Carleton B.
Joeckel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleton_B._Joeckel), and
[archive.org](http://archive.org) has a copy of his [The
Government of the American Public
Library](http://archive.org/details/governmentofthea010579mbp).

**Note**: While Joeckel's book has been cited numerous times (and
there is, by the way, some interesting references to that book in
Jesse H. Shera's important work, [Foundations of the Public
Library](http://archive.org/details/foundationsofthe012037mbp),
this article has only been cite three times (via Google Scholar),
and one of those citations is from Joeckel's 2nd part of this
article.
