**Note:** The seventeenth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Library
Education."

It was written by Walter Lichtenstein, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Chicago, Illinois (No affiliation)

**Note:** An interesting comment on library schools / education,
which comes after a comment on education as an example of mass
production:

> So also in our library schools much time is spent in teaching
> pupils how to catalog, how to order books, how to classify the
> books for the shelves when received, what is the best manner of
> distributing them to the people, etc. Much less time seems to be
> spent in teaching what books really are, what differentiates one
> book from another, what type of books a particular library had
> better specialize in, and how the people ought to get the most
> out of libraries (p. 270).

Although the article begins with some good comments, as above, it
uses those comments as premises to derive invalid conclusions. One
of the conclusions drawn in this article is that library schools
cannot teach people to know books as well the specific academic
fields can and, therefore, academic libraries should be staffed by
scholars and not librarians.

I don't mind arguments against library schools or library
education, but the arguments presented in this article are
foolish. The author would have served his argument better if he
had continued his argument against library education rather than
arguing, implicitly by support of other academic fields, that it
could never suffice. This is the first *LQ* article in these first
four volumes that left me rather annoyed.
