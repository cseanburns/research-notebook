**Note:** The first article of the fourth issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Recent Social Trends
and Future Library Policy."

It was written by J. H. Shera, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Miami University

**Note:** Enter Shera.

**Note:** This piece begins with a scolding (Shera was good at
this) of those librarians who fail to see "the need for a
sociological concept of the library profession" (p. 339).

**Note:** Shera discusses Borden's work (see [my notes on the
piece by Borden](/blog/2013/09/17/lq-vol-1-issue-3-article-3-reading-study/)).

> Any adequate interpretation of future library policy must
> necessarily, therefore, be based on a thorough recognition of
> **the library as the product of social and economic forces**
> that have been evolving during the past three-quarters of a
> century. Mr. Borden, in the paper previously cited, has
> admirably paved the way for these new concepts \[emphasis
> added\] (p. 340).

**Note:** It's weird reading this because it's so current:

> Suffice it here to state that the downward trend of the
> birth-rate and the extension of the expectation of life and
> resulting aging of our population cannot but affect materially
> the type of public that librarians of the future will serve. The
> census of 1930 showed unmistakably that our period of rapid
> growth in numbers is definitely at an end. With the older people
> constituting an increasingly larger percentage of our
> population, the demand for leisure-time activities and the
> services of the librarian should increase, while the children's
> librarians, relieved of the burden of ever increasing numbers to
> serve, can shift their attention from quantity to quality (pp.
> 341-342).

**Note:** I'm often interested in what people and sources these
early *LQ* authors cite. It would be interesting to study that.

**Note:** Interesting discussion of decentralization. See p. 345.

**Note:** Writing about how libraries can serve various aesthetic
functions, "make beauty increasingly a vital part of our lives"
(p. 349), Shera writes for a fluid definition / conception of the
library:

> There will be many who will argue that all this is without the
> province of the library---that a library is not a museum---that
> such confusion of purpose strikes at the very heart of the
> library's true function. In the cities, with large art
> collections and great museums just around the corner, such a
> rigid interpretation of the function of the library may be well
> and good. But in the increasingly important village the library
> must broaden its scope and become a true cultural center (p.
> 349).

**Note:** How like the 1930s to the present.

The Depression and its effects:

> The profession is confronted by the first serious crisis in its
> short history. Ever since the publication, over a year ago, of
> Mr. Joeckel's important study of supply and demand in the
> library field, librarians have long known of the ravages of
> unemployment in their ranks; and much has been written about it
> but little has been done (p. 350).

Shera is referring to a piece Joeckel published in *Library
Journal*, but Joeckel has also published articles in *LQ*. See
[notes](/blog/categories/author-joeckel/).

**Note:** Again, scathing. Shera continues from above:

> It is needless to point out the inevitable consequences and
> economic folly of this short-sighted policy. Suffice it to say
> that if a service is worth rendering, it merits compensation,
> and if librarians persist in the sanction of such practices they
> can anticipate little relief from their present ills (p. 350).

And now he scolds library schools (just continuing from previous
sentence):

> Yet, in the face of all this, the library schools are not
> cooperating as they should. Even the chairman of the Junior
> Members Round Table of the A.L.A. is compelled to admit that
> "While some schools are radically reducing enrollment, others
> are merely making a gesture." This is not time to allow personal
> institutional pride to work against the best interests of the
> profession. There must be a "domestic allotment plan" for the
> library schools (pp. 350-351).

**Note:** Could see it coming. He proposes a central planning
commission that would have a great deal of authority of all
libraries in the U.S.

**Note:** Reading Shera is always interesting. Usually brilliant.
I must admit, though, that I can almost here a
[Palpatine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine) laugh when I
read this line:

> This does not mean that local libraries will have to surrender
> much of their present autonomy. As a matter of fact they will be
> virtually as independent as they now are. **Only as their
> individual policies might work at cross-purposes with the
> master-plan will they feel the presence of any restraint or
> authority** \[emphasis added\] (pp. 351-352).

**Note:** Sometimes I think that Shera is way too quick on the
draw, and I disagree with some of his arguments in this article,
but I do think this is true:

> Librarians must create vision and venturesome leadership or the
> profession will suffer. They must take their calling more
> seriously, define their functions more closely, engage in more
> searching self-criticism, in more radical professional thought;
> ... (p. 353).
