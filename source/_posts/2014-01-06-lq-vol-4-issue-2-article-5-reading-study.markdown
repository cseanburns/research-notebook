**Note:** The fifth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "J.
C. M. Hanson and International Cataloging."

It was written by William Warner Bishop, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan Library

**Note:** A nice intro that puts cataloging in
historical perspective from the 1934 vantage point:

> Few of the younger librarians of the present day can
> realize or fully understand the situation of
> cataloging in the nineties of the last century.
> Libraries in Britain and America were mostly small, as
> we now count numbers. In Europe there were more of the
> sizeable sort, almost all of the learned or
> "scientific" type. What agreement on cataloging
> practice had been reached in any country was chiefly
> based on certain well-known codes intended for very
> large libraries---the British Museum Rules, the
> **Bodleian rules**, the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale rules,
> and the foreshadowings of the Prussian and the
> Austrian **Instructions**. In America, breaking away
> in part from these examples, Mr. Cutter had published
> two editions of his **Rules for a dictionary
> catalogue**, first in 1876. There were certain
> practices reduced to rules by the New York State
> Library School (p. 165).

The paragraph continues. What strikes me about it is
that even Cutter's rules today are presented as if they
were created *ex nihilo*. This paragraph, all by itself,
puts the entire enterprise in context.

**Note:** The following is an interesting footnote.
After making a statement, Bishop writes in footnote 6:

> I am writing this on the ocean far from any books of
> reference for verifying what I trust are fairly
> accurate recollections (p. 165).

**Note:** As far as I can tell, there is finally a
straightforward indication that this issue is dedicated
to J. C. M. Hanson. On Hanson's work to develop
"preliminary edition of the Anglo-American *Code of
catalog rules* (p. 166), Bishop writes:

> No one claims it is perfect, but it is a great piece
> of constructive work, due to the labor of many able
> men, but guided by one whom we honor in this group of
> articles (p. 167).

**Note:** Nice explanation of the intent behind the
above named rules. This has been the intent of various
rules and schemes (perhaps but more broadly) unto this
day:

> One feature of Hanson's work is but little understood.
> His aim---and that of his committee---was to make a
> code usable and indispensable for great libraries, but
> also capable of being followed in smaller and more
> popular libraries without serious vexation and undue
> confusion (p. 167).

**Note:** This achievement cannot be understated:

> Ninety-nine out of a hundred titles in the ordinary
> library can be and are cataloged with printed cards
> made under this code. It requires a genius for
> concrete statements and for clearness to make this
> sort of result possible (p. 167).
