**Note:** The first article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
Democratic Function of Public Libraries."

It was written by Grace O. Kelley, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Queens Borough Public Library

**Note:** And this is one of the core beliefs about
(free) public libraries:

> Of all such essays none has been more truly democratic
> and liberal in motive, or, dare we say, in some
> respects naïve, than the creation of the free public
> library (p. 1).

This article does not take the above notion granted.
Instead it examines, and perhaps, criticizes the notion.
Such that:

> Today, economic and political conditions are such that
> librarians are being forced to examine these broad
> assumptions to find out what measure of truth lies
> therein; to determine more clearly the actual relation
> which exists between the library and the people whom
> it serves; and to explain the nature and to justify
> the results of library service. They are realizing
> that the hoped-for ends are not implicit nor realized
> automatically, but that "critical attention" to the
> direction and character of its growth" is needed if
> the public library is to be a "true agency for
> education" (p. 3).

Again, this is written during the Great Depression.

**Note:** If there has been a paradigm shift, in a
slightly Kuhnian sense but more cultural, then it
happened because of a gestalt switch in how libraries
have been conceived over time:

> Before the appearance of the free library as we know
> it today it is worth noting that the word "library"
> had a different meaning. The precursors of the public
> library had been the private libraries, the
> proprietary, academy, and society libraries, the
> college, university, and state libraries, none of
> these wholly free or tax-supported. The right of using
> the books was usually granted only to those who met
> prescribed conditions as to education, fees, and
> membership, although it is doubtless true that the
> serious student could obtain the privilege without
> subscribing to all of the conditions (p. 4).

**Note:** Just a tidbit -- the author uses the term
"library world" on page 5. Earliest record of the use of
that term?

**Note:** On special libraries -- the term *special* is
in quotes in the previous sentence (unquoted):

> The special library, so called for want of a better
> term, is the direct and inevitable product of the
> machine age and of the era of specialization in all
> fields of knowledge. Wealth has increased, education
> has expanded, and occupational opportunities have
> changed, releasing vast numbers from routine work and
> making it necessary for them to prepare themselves for
> other kinds of activity. The older professions have
> increased their numbers and have required that their
> employees meet definite educational standards (p. 5).

**Note:** The relation of special library and other
libraries to the topic of this article, the free public
library:

> Thus, before and since the era of the free public
> library, all other libraries have been almost entirely
> selective institutions established for use under
> prescribed conditions. Particular needs of certain
> classes of readers have been met. With the exception
> of the proprietary libraries, the various types which
> existed before the public library continue to function
> today in increased strength and numbers. To these have
> been added the highly selective special library, a
> direct outgrowth of the present age of specialization
> (p. 7).

And in light of these contrasting libraries:

> In distinction to all of these, the function of the
> free public library has been to serve the people as a
> whole, collectively; the masses, the general public,
> the ordinary folk, were to be supplied with books in
> preparation for the duties which democracy was
> thrusting upon them (p. 7).

**Note:** Important distinction between public education
and public libraries, in terms of control from above:

> Where in education youth is guided and regimented in
> its activity by state-supported teachers who are
> influenced by the authority of tradition in the form
> of established curricula, the only guide for service
> to the clientèle of the library has been the variety
> of reading interests of library patrons as interpreted
> by the librarian. True, occasional social pressures
> restricting the librarian's choice have been brought
> to bear in the way of censorship of certain books; the
> actual effect of this, however, has been small in
> comparison with the total amount of freedom enjoyed
> (p. 8).

**Note:** Nice point about what it means to be a
librarian given that library use is not at all
obligatory by anyone:

> The librarian must use his ingenuity and tact to the
> utmost to arouse and hold his patrons, the actual use
> of the library never being obligatory in any way, but
> resulting always from the purely voluntary urge of the
> patron (p. 9).

**Note:** As relevant a discussion point today as then:

> "An industrial civilization founded on technology,
> science, invention, and expanding markets must of
> necessity change and change rapidly." Any institution
> which does not change too, adapt itself to the times,
> and become part of the onward "drive to change," will
> be pushed aside to be left perhaps for a time to make
> a harmless life of its own (p. 10).

The quote is from footnote 16:

> C. A. Beard, **A Charter for the social sciences in
> the schools** (New York, 1932), pp. 28, 31.

**Note:** On page 12, the author discusses the *recent*
development of reader adviser services.

**Note:** Interesting argument about the role of
librarians at the end of the article --- to make
accessible specialized research to the general public in
a form that the general public will appreciate.
