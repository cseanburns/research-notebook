I will be closely revisiting some writings by Robert K.
Merton--specifically the following three pieces, in the following
order--in [The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical
Investigations](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817893417):

1. "The Normative Structure of Science"
1. "Priority in Scientific Discovery"
1. "The Matthew Effect in Science"

The introduction in the above book, written by Norman W. Storer,
is a good overview of Merton's work. Although I have read these
works before, I did so over the course of a couple years. Reading
them again in this order will help shape some of my thoughts on
the matter.

About the "The Normative Structure of Science," Storer writes,

> In this paper appeared the comprehensive statement of ideal
> norms to which scientists are oriented in their relations with
> each other: universalism, communism, organized skepticism, and
> disinterestedness" (p. xviii).

Regrading the criticism of these ideals, Storer writes,

> Criticism, however, has been concentrated not so much on its
> having mistaken the components of this ethos [*ethos of
> science*], but on the question whether these norms in fact guide
> scientific everyday behavior (p. xviii).

Pages xviii and on are good for additional explanation.

**Note:** My PeerJ research, for example, is a beginning look at
whether the open access, open science, etc. call to arms aligns
itself to or deviates itself from this *ethos of science*.

Yet, despite the headway made with "The Normative Structure of
Science" and other works, Storer writes,

> Merton had already outlined the normative structure of science
> and had suggested how the four norms interact with each other in
> a functioning whole. But there was no clearly defined,
> distinctive source of "energy" in the system--no sense of why it
> should "move" (p. xxiii).

Then comes the "Priority in Scientific Discovery." Further down on
that page, Storer writes, 

> Here was the energy that could drive the system, the
> distinctively institutionalized motivation that could account
> for scientists' orientations to the ethos of science and for
> their willingness to accept its often demanding strictures (p.
> xxiii).

Then I will tie this together with "The Matthew Effect in
Science." There is a particular part in this piece that touches
not just on an *ethos of science* but on an *aesthetics of
science*, which I believe may be profoundly important. This is the
cornerstone of my upcoming *ASIS&T* [panel
presentation](http://asis.org/asist2013/abstracts/panels/36.html).
I'll link to the full abstract when it comes online.

It was nice to read Norman W. Storer's intro. Scholarly
introductions, book reviews, etc., can often be underrated.
