**Note:** The twenty-eighth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "On the Use of
Ultra-Violet Rays for Detecting Repairs in Printed Books,
Especially Incunabula."

It was written by Eugène Tisserant, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana

**Note:** A short piece on detecting repair work in rare books.
Repair work had advanced and it was sometimes difficult to tell
with the naked eye if a work had been treated. The author presents
a simple technique for identifying whether a rare book had been
fixed.
