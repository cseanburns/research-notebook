**Note:** The fifth article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "A
Bibliographical and Literary Study of the First
Appearance of the 'Arabian Nights' in Europe."

It was written by Duncan B. Macdonald, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Hartford, Connecticut (No Affiliation)

**Note:** I don't usually attempt to trace all the
authors who have no stated affiliation, but the
following line sparked by interest:

> This, then, is an attempt to give an exact
> bibliographical description, a **visu**, of the
> original edition of Galland's **Mille et une nuit**,
> of certain early reprints and translations of the
> same, and of some other early editions of cognate
> books, all in my possession. The Galland **editio
> princeps** is exceedingly rare; even the copy in the
> BibliothÃ¨que Nationale is incomplete; and no exact
> description of it seems so far to have been made (pp.
> 387-388).

Specifically, that Macdonald would have possession of
these works made me think that he might be a rare book
collector, and I thought it interesting that an early
contributor to *LQ* would be one among this trade. A
quick web search, though, shows that Macdonald was a
professor, retired just around the time of the
publication of this article. He has a inter-faith
theological center named after him (if I have truly
traced the correct Macdonald): [The Duncan Black
Macdonald Center for the Study of Islam and
Christian-Muslim
Relations](http://www.hartsem.edu/macdonald/brief-history).
The following is an article that discusses the person
in a little more detail (link in the above page): [A
Century of Arabic and Islamic Studies at Hartford
Seminary](http://www.hartsem.edu/sites/default/files/macdonald/articles/bijlefeldarticle.pdf).

**Note:** The article proceeds according to its title.
It includes rather detailed bibliographical descriptions
of the volumes of work that disseminated (first in
France) the *Arabian Nights* stories in France in the
early 18th century. These descriptions also include some
background stories about the volumes.

**Note:** A new section titled "English Translation."
This interesting bit:

> There seems to be no clue as to when the **Nights**
> appeared first in English. Some unknown translator at
> a very early date turned Galland's artistic French
> into the strangest Grub Street English. Also he seems
> to have rendered from a La Haye edition.

I have not heard the term *Grub Street English*, but
there's a [Wikipedia
page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grub_Street) for it.

**Note:** I omit the detail, but this line says
something about the audience Macdonald hopes to reach by
publishing in *LQ*:

> But the question belongs to the history of literature
> rather than to bibliography (p. 412).
