**Note:** The sixth article of the third issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Dr. Gottlieb August
Crüwell, 1866-1931."

It was written by J. C. M. Hanson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** I wasn't planning to comment on non-research or
non-scholarly articles, but I also didn't realize that I had saved
such a piece. The last article in this issue is a notice that Dr.
Gottlieb August Crüwell had passed away. Hanson writes a little
about his life and his contributions, which include a piece that
was published in the [previous
issue](/blog/2013/11/07/lq-vol-2-issue-2-article-4-reading-study/).
Hanson comments are touching and I'm surprised to find myself a
little sad. A photograph of Dr. Crüwell resides on the
*europeana.eu* digital library: [Crüwell, Gottlieb
August](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92060/D012A3A4B5368676CCB8D5A13F09D5652486CF91.html).
