**Note:** The first article of the first issue of the first volume
of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Aspects of Education for
Librarianship in America."

It was written by Louis R. Wilson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of North Carolina

**Note:** Wilson's overall goal with this article is to describe
the state of affairs at the time. To set it up, he provides a
little history.

As the title suggests, the article is primarily about librarian
education, library schools, library faculty, library curricula,
future directions, and so forth.

**Note:** On library research and on the purpose of library
research.

> Investigation in the library field will probably never be as
> exact as that in the sciences. It may have to partake of the
> nature of investigation in the social sciences and education.
> But it is essential if librarians are to understand the point of
> view of workers in other disciplines in the field, and if they
> are to increase the effectiveness of the library as an
> educational and social instrument (p. 8).

**Note:** Not really relevant to anything I'm doing, but I believe
this is the first mention of the Depression in this study:

> Just now, owing to the depression, difficulty is being
> experienced by some of the schools in placing their graduates
> (p. 9).

**Note:** Still applicable today and, with a few word
substitutions, still current:

> Similarly, librarians must be trained who will be effective in
> making books available to rural populations, who understand the
> book needs of patients in hospitals, who can elicit interest in
> books and support of libraries through the radio, and who are
> skilled in co-ordinating and guiding the various agencies which
> are engaged in general adult education activities (pp. 9-10).
