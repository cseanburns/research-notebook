**Note:** The thirtieth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Heights of Books in
Relation to Height of Stack Tiers."

It was written by Henry B. Van Hoesen and Norman L. Kilpatrick,
who were affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Brown University Library

**Note:** On the most economical and efficient use of shelving.
Again, it's utterly important to think about this kind of think in
a library. In many ways, this is a very important topic if only
because of the amount of money that is needed to store and care
for so many books. However, it's not really clear why this article
is in this issue. The only connection to Hanson is the issue of
describing the physical dimensions of books in the catalog, but
this is only mentioned briefly at the beginning of the article.

Here's a nice quote:

> We have recently measured about 100,000 volumes at Brown
> University. The results are in Table I (p. 355).

And to continue:

> This paper should be considered merely tentative and incomplete.
> Our estimate of 82 per cent for octavos (25 cm. high), Mr.
> Gerould's estimate of 85 per cent, and the Yale estimate of 87
> 1/2 per cent (reckoning the octavo at 26 cm. high) may not be so
> different when we have measured 400,000 volumes instead of
> 100,000 (p. 357).

And more measuring of books:

> Four hundred thousand is quite a lot of books to measure, but it
> may not be enough, and we should welcome collaboration in
> further measurements, tabulations, and conclusions (p. 357).
