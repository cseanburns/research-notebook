**Note:** The second article of the fourth issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Observations on Financing Libraries."

It was written by Simeon E. Leland, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** The second article on the Great Depression and
libraries.

**Note:** On valuating public services:

> The first problem of government, therefore, is to
> evaluate collective social wants and create means for
> sating them. The techniques employed in making these
> valuations have to date been very crude, consisting
> largely in the political appraisal of voters' demands
> rather than in the scientific weighing of the social
> utilities of various governmental services or
> combinations of functions (pp. 344-345).

**Note:** More on the role of government (and an
indication of future dominance of cost / benefit
analyses):

> In such a set-up every institution supported by public
> funds can reasonably be called upon to demonstrate its
> social utility, to prove its capacity to render
> service on a least social cost basis, and to
> demonstrate the extent of the benefits conferred upon
> the community (p. 345).

Leland then notes that the value of the public library,
in terms of its government support, should be weighed
against the value of other services and functions the
government funds and supports, and this all lies with
the support of the taxpayers.

**Note:** The Depression is influencing the important
questions (note the causal link between economic
scarcity and questions about essential services). Note
also the attitude about recreation:

> Is the library so vital a part of the educational
> system that its facilities should be within reasonable
> reach of all of the inhabitants of the country? Or is
> the function of the library essentially recreational
> rather than educational, so that it should be
> classified with the permissive functions of government
> rather than with activities rendering essential public
> services (p. 347).

**Note:** Bottom of page 348, there's an important
discussion of library boards. Connect this section with
the two articles written by Joeckel on public libraries
and governance: [Joeckel 1931a][1] and [Joeckel
1931b][2].

**Note:** A discussion about government centralization
and how libraries should respond:

> Many library boards, with their sovereign independence
> to hire and fire irrespective of municipal civil
> service codes, and their independent tax levies and
> self-controlled budgets and treasuries, will oppose
> this general movement to simplify and improve the
> effectiveness of the governmental machine. A large
> part of this opposition probably is based upon the
> fear that the change will decrease the funds available
> for library support. To hedge against this, the
> libraries should study their financial problems, the
> methods for improving services, and the means for
> reducing costs (p. 350).

**Note:** Then more on the reasons why librarians should
provide data that highlights their value. See page 351.

This discussion shows that the early drive to understand
a library's community arose out of a possible need to
justify the existence of the library as a tax funded
institution. The input / output / outcome literature
surely stems from these early discussions. The questions
at the top of page 352 are still being asked.

**Note:** On the type of analysis:

> This method of approaching the problem is designated
> as "unite cost analysis." The cost accounting methods
> which are here involved have been applied for many
> years to private undertakings, but only recently have
> they been developed as aids in intelligent fiscal
> administration for governmental bodies. So far as is
> known, the unit cost approach has not, as yet, been
> applied to library work. The operations of the
> library, however, can be readily adapted to this
> approach. Costs of library circulation, reference
> service, cataloguing, indexing, and
> bibliography-making can all be calculated on this
> basis (p. 353-354).

**Note:** An important discussion about costs of
personnel and costs of collections takes place on pages
355-357. The discussion is based on data. The following
quote is from the first sentence of the main paragraph
on page 357 and highlights the importance of the
librarian as a professional (even if not stated as such)
relative to the material at hand in the library. The
whole paragraph is highly interesting:

> These personal services may also have greater social
> utility than the mere aggregation of reading matter
> and may be required to secure the greatest usefulness
> from book collections (p. 357).

And then, more on the importance of the librarian (as
I've stated elsewhere, the librarian is what makes a
library, otherwise a library is simply a warehouse):

> Such a concept of the library implies more than
> well-filled book shelves with a clerk to dispense the
> volumes. It calls for adequate personnel to carry the
> library to its patrons, to increase the velocity of
> book circulation, to interest children in literature
> and to tell them stories, to hunt up the sources of
> information on any subject, to cross-index collections
> in order to maximize their usefulness, and to do a
> score of things which trained librarians daily
> accomplish (p. 357).

**Note:** I haven't commented on this yet, but there is
a lot of useful data in this early articles. For
example, this article cites library income per patron.

**Note:** This is somewhat funny, in a depressing sort
of way, because it hasn't really changed:

> The folly of drawing political boundary lines within
> which governments are to be locally supported with
> little or no relation to wealth or taxable capacity is
> rapidly being recognized. Investigations of these
> absurdities and inequalities in the field of library
> finance have not been made, but the meager income
> available to many small libraries reflects these
> conditions (p. 364).

**Note:** Ha, libraries have always had to apply methods
to limit the monopolizing of resources:

> One library has even imposed a service charge for the
> use of city directories and similar publications
> providing they are monopolized by single readers for
> more than a stipulated maximum time (p. 366).

And after listing a variety of ways libraries can levy
fees, this important note:

> Nevertheless, the revenue possibilities of such fees
> are probably very limited (p. 366).

**Note:** Interesting note about the ultimate value of
the library (not in the hands of the librarians):

> It remains for others to decide whether the claim of
> the library to a portion of the public funds is equal
> to, or greater than, or even inferior to, the claims
> of other departments and other public services. This
> question as to what governments should do with their
> limited resources is not for the librarians to
> determine, and in the long run the decision will not
> be theirs (p. 366).

And thus begins the eighty year effort to argue for the
value of the library so that the public continues to
support it:

> They can help secure an answer favorable to themselves
> and to their cause by studying the institution which
> they manage and by learning the facts concerning their
> services and their fiscal operation (p. 366).
