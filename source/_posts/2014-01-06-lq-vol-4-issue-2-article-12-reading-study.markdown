**Note:** The twelfth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Classification Problems in an
International Special Library."

It was written by Sigmund von Frauendorfer, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** International Institute of Agriculture

**Note:** The main gist of the article is the difficulty in
adapting and applying a classification system in a special
library. I don't have much to say about this piece. It is probably
most interesting to those who are concerned with the
classification of specific fields of study (in this instance,
agriculture) and to those who manage libraries with a patron base
that is international.
