**Note:** The fourth article of the first issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Difficulties
Encountered by Trained School Librarians as a Basis for the
Revision of the Professional Curriculum."

It was written by Charles H. Stone, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of North Carolina, Woman's College

**Note:** A really interesting article on the particular needs of
school librarians and their library education.

**Note:** The following can be generalized beyond school librarian
training / education. It's a common concern:

> Third, librarians going into school libraries experience
> greatest difficulties in problems which involve the dealing with
> personalities. The school library supervisors agree that this is
> true. In this case, again, about half of the persons reporting
> lack of adequate training state that library science courses
> could help prepare for that situation. Many comments were made
> to the effect that only tact, experience, or innate personality
> would avail (p. 80).

But there's been advancement with this.
