**Note:** The fourth article of the third issue of the
second volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
Administration of the Library Budget."

It was written by Floyd W. Reeves and John Dale Russell,
who were affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** An extension of their earlier study, also
published in *LQ*. My notes on that: [The Relation of
the College Library to Recent Movements in Higher
Education, *LQ 1*(1),
57-66](/blog/2013/07/25/lq-vol-1-issue-1-article-6-autoethnographic-study/).

**Note:** This study was the result of quite a bit of
travel:

> Although the great majority of the colleges studied
> are in the Central West, information was gathered from
> institutions located in twenty-two different states.
> All the data are based on information gathered by
> personal visits in either the year 1928-29 or the year
> 1929-30. The studies related to financial matters are
> based upon a painstaking analysis of the accounts in
> the business offices of the institutions.

**Note:** When did people stop using the median! It
seems common practice during this time (and more
accurate than today's common use of the mean):

> Investigation as to the amount of expenditures for the
> library in the various colleges included in this study
> showed that the median annual expenditure per student
> for this purpose is $12.25. Institutions holding the
> highest type of accreditation, i.e., those on the
> approved list of the Association of American
> Universities, spend notably more per student ($14.21)
> than is spent by institutions not on the approved list
> ($9.03). The typical sum spend for library services is
> 4 1/2-5 per cent of the entire educational expenditure
> (p. 269).

**Note:** Quite a bit of discussion about how libraries
allocate book collection funds. One dominating practice
of the day was to allocate book collection funds by
college department. Some libraries even went the route
of a flat tax--so that no matter the department, its
needs, or its use of the library, each department
received the same base allotment.

**Note:** The authors discuss a number of important
factors in book fund allocation:

> The development of a satisfactory distribution of book
> funds among departments is actually a rather
> complicated matter. There are at least six important
> factors to be taken into account in allocating funds
> for new books to departments (p. 271).

1. Distribution of students by department, per
   enrollment (pp. 271-272).
1. Distribution of use by library by department (p.
   272).
1. Distribution of new publications by field of study
   (p. 272).
1. Distribution of "relative cost of books per volume
   unit in various fields" (p. 273).
1. Nature of "existing conditions of the library
   collections in the several fields" (p. 273).
1. The needs of new instructors: "A teacher who is just
   joining the faculty will usually find that the
   library lacks several titles which he considers
   important for the use of his classes" (p. 273).

**Note:** The authors comment on the above six factors:

> A review of the six factors which should be taken into
> account in allotting funds for new books to various
> departments shows how complex the problem is. Clearly,
> no cut-and-dried formula, applicable alike to all
> institutions, can be expected to work satisfactorily.
> Two of the factors--the amount of new material coming
> out in the several fields, and the cost of books per
> volume unit in the several subjects--can well be
> reduced to a constant which is valid for all colleges
> alike. Another factor, the enrolments in the
> respective departments, can be reduced to statistical
> terms; and the keeping of adequate circulation
> statistics will yield valuable data on the relative
> use of library materials by the several departments.
> The last two factors discussed--the existing condition
> of the library collection, and the needs of new
> instructors--require individual attention in each
> college (pp. 273-274).

**Note:** An important comment, which I'm glad to see,
because it hasn't and will most likely always be this
way:

> A matter that complicates still further the allocation
> of book funds to departments is the fact that colleges
> are utterly lacking in uniformity in their
> departmental organization (p. 274).

And, they shouldn't be classified as such:

> Furthermore, these departmental groupings do not
> correspond closely in detail to the systems used in
> classifying library books (p. 274).

**Note:** This problem went away a long time ago, but I
can see, for reasons I'll skip now, a possible
resurgence:

> A final problem relates to whether the funds allotted
> for the purchase of new books for the several
> departments shall be considered a part of the
> departmental budget or a part of the library budget
> (p. 275).
