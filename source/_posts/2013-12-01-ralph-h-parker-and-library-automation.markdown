Ralph Halstead Parker was a remarkable librarian and I'm happy I
had the chance to write about him. The pre-publication print of
my paper on him is out (published by *portal: Libraries and the
Academy*). See this
[page][1], or directly access the article: ["Academic Libraries and
Automation: A Historical Reflection on Ralph Halstead
Parker][2].
