**Note:** The fifth article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Need of College and University
Instruction in Use of the Library."

It was written by Peyton Hurt, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of California

**Note:** This will be an important article too -- simply because
of its topic matter. However, I'm always surprised by this
expectation:

> College and university librarians are repeatedly astonished at
> the lack of knowledge of library technique on the part of
> students, research workers, and even on the part of instructors
> (p. 436).

Why would they have the expectation that any of these people would
have the necessary skills?

**Note:** This is one of those studies that show we still ask the
same kinds of general questions today.

> There is a question, however, of just how much or how little the
> average person knows of the technique of using a library as a
> source of information on subjects that interest him personally
> (p. 436).

And:

> How much does the undergraduate and the graduate student, in the
> course of his college and university studies, learn concerning
> methods of using a library (p. 436)?

And:

> What changes, if any, are needed in our educational system if we
> are to develop a greater degree of student independence and
> initiative in using the library as a source of information (p.
> 436)?

The last question is especially important. Note the desired
outcome: student independence. Long the goal of academic
libraries.

**Note:** One of the subtle points of this article seems to be
that reference is an overused substitute for solid library use
instruction. That's an interesting point. Take the following:

> One familiar with the library research methods employed by the
> great majority of students must realize that this independent
> work is far too often work for the library assistant, with
> little beneficial training for the student (p. 443).

**Note:** And this is a brilliant passage:

> It would seem fair to ask if it would not be advisable to teach
> the use of library materials and then throw the students into
> the ponds of economics, history, biology, and other subjects, to
> the abandonment of the time-honored method of instruction by
> lectures and assigned reading. Would not such procedure lead to
> continued study and reading on the part of those who become
> interested in various subjects? Would it not tend to create
> independence and initiative which would be highly useful after
> college courses were a thing of the past? Would it not pave the
> way for intelligent adult self-education (p. 443)?

**Note:** Library use instruction:

> As a result of the present study, the university is introducing
> a course in library use and general bibliography. The course,
> under the School of Librarianship, will be open to upper
> division and graduate students in all fields, but will be
> designed especially to meet the needs of students in the social
> sciences (p. 444).

**Note:** Need to come back to this article in the future. Aside
from the topic matter, the article is historically interesting for
its listing of general reference works and library methods that
were considered necessary at the time.
