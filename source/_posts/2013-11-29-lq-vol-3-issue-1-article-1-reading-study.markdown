**Note:** The first article of the first issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Community Studies in Reading: 1. Reading in the Lower
East Side."

It was written by Douglas Waples, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** The article begins with a description of brief
cultural and historical description of the community and
explains why this community is an important focus of
study for reading habits:

> To understand the distribution of reading matter, one
> must be able to answer such questions as these: What
> proportion of the population are readers? From what
> sources or agencies (such as newstands, rental
> libraries, home libraries, settlement libraries,
> bookstores, pushcarts, book clubs, reading-rooms, and
> public libraries) do the readers get their reading?
> What kinds of reading matter and what proportion of
> each kind does each occupational group obtain from
> each source (p. 2)?

**Note:** Waples then details how to collect data and
then asks the important question:

> Granting the possibility of securing such facts, one
> may well ask what they are worth. There are at least
> four plausible answers (p. 3).

**Note:** The first is to measure "social intelligence"
(p. 3). But here, he notes, it is not simply that a
community reads but that a community reads well-balanced
material:

> If the writing be sincere, competent, and
> multi-partisan, the more widely it is read, the better
> for the whole community. Its consumption by the
> general reader is a fair measure of social
> consciousness, of the desire to meet critical issues
> rationally, and of unwillingness to evade them. Hence
> the facts about community reading on current social
> problems teach us much about man as a social animal.
> They help us to find out how social he is: according
> to his occupation, age, schooling, race, and habitat
> (p. 3).

Note the demographic characteristics he adds in the
above passage.

**Note:** The second reason is to measure the value of
reading. Even then, librarians and library scholars were
dealing with alternate methods of communication, then it
was radio, today it is the Internet. In the paragraph
after the one below, he also mentions as sources of
competition with reading: friends, motion pictures,
museum exhibits, lectures, and school courses (p. 4):

> Secondly, the facts show what reading is actually
> worth in the given community as a vehicle for ideas,
> and as compared with other arts of communication. One
> sure thing is that critical reading in some American
> communities is not provoked even by national disaster.
> The angels weep when devout public librarians foist
> "good reading" upon a radio-minded town (p. 3).

Thus:

> Hence, before we take adult reading too seriously, it
> behooves us to learn how successfully reading competes
> with the other arts of communication (p. 4).

**Note:** A third reason is to measure the comparison
between library reading and reading obtained from other
sources. This point is a matter of economy and of,
according to Waples, libraries being efficient agencies.

> In the third place, and assuming that adult reading is
> sufficient in amount and distribution to be an
> important source of ideas, we need to know how library
> reading in the given community compares with reading
> obtained from other sources, if only to avoid
> expensive duplication. Given a picture of the total
> reading situation, where does library reading fit in?
> To answer this question is the first step toward a
> planned economy of public librarianship, that is, a
> program aimed at results of cultural value to the
> whole community that are not accomplished by other
> agencies (p. 4).

It's interesting that he writes this:

> In times of economic collapse, these questions matter
> a great deal more, particularly to the watchdogs of
> the city treasury. Hence, the urge toward
> self-preservation, if not professional curiosity,
> should make them interesting. Having mastered the
> essential problems of administration and come to grips
> with the psychology of reading, librarians now
> confront the mysteries of sociology. The present time
> is ripe for a formulation of social policy, and we
> lack the necessary facts (p. 4).

**Note:** A fourth reason is to understand how to
provide the appropriate reading material. This is an
historically important reason:

> A fourth reason for collecting the facts is that the
> more we know about the sort of reading most acceptable
> to different population groups, the better able we are
> to select **good** reading for the library. We cannot
> say what **is** good reading until we can answer the
> questions "good for whom?" and "good for what?" (p.
> 5).

Waples then criticizes the use of the Pulitzer award,
but it would seem that any such device as an indicator
of good reading would be sufficient for questioning, as
a measure of what is good reading. Very interesting
argument.

**Note:** Waples proceeds to discuss the neighborhood
under study. This bit on sexual material, just by nature
of being in this article, is fascinating:

> There has been a perceptible decline in the sales of
> the sex magazines---partly due to the competition of
> salacious books and partly to the fact that sex
> magazines have not reduced their price; **Gay
> parisienne**, **La Paree**, **Paris nights**, **Pep
> stories**, **Snappy stories**, **Spicy stories**, and
> **Ten story** each sell for a quarter. These are
> obtainable only from the stands, including the ten or
> twelve stationary shops that sell old magazines for a
> very few cents, depending on how old they are (p. 7).

**Note:** Seems like book stores have always looked back
to some golden age (of course, the following passage
could simply be referring to times before the
Depression):

> Also, the proprietors know books. They impress one as
> good people---courageous in their determination to
> believe that this unhappy world will always contain
> readers of good books, yet wistful of the old days
> whenever the talk turns upon sales (p. 9).

**Note:** This is a really provoking description of a
book store:

> The famous shop of Maisel on Grand street deserves a
> book of its own. One rarely meets an individual more
> competent than the proprietor to select the sort of
> books that everyone should read; nor does one often
> feel the seductive fascination of books so strongly as
> when poking around his shelves. Forty-five years at
> the same address, a warm interest in people as such,
> and an instinct for the well-written book in any
> tongue and on any theme, have produced a literary
> shrine of unusual richness. It feels a holy place (p.
> 9).

**Note:** The next passage relates an interview, with
quotes, with someone who sells books by a pushcart.

And then Waples, with or without explicit intention,
makes a case for qualitative methodology:

> Such people are mentioned with no interest of
> substituting sentiment for figures. They demonstrate
> the presence of thoroughly good people in the local
> book trades--nearly prostrate though the business is.
> Such people make for a qualitative influence of
> reading which numbers do not catch (p. 10).

**Note:** Next Waples begins to focus on the public
library. He first describes the role of occupation and
the kind of information the occupation variable can
contain.

> Occupation is the central fact in the lives of most
> Americans. Hence in comparing populations of any sort,
> it is convenient to compare the proportions engaged in
> different kinds of work. Occupation is perhaps the
> best single label, because it usually implies
> significant differences in schooling, intelligence,
> and economic status, and often implies differences in
> cultural status and age (p. 11).

**Note:** Interesting observation about the relationship
between sex and reading (see page 12). Waples finds,
surprisingly for him, that sex does not predict the
amount of reading (both sexes read about the same
amount) but it is able to say something about what is
read.

**Note:** This is kind of funny. On page 13, Waples
lists a number of reasons that affect library use. The
list includes items that are still valid today, but this
one is striking and telling of the times:

> Among the conditions which obviously affect popular
> use of the library are ... the inability to smoke
> (which should bother some women as much as it bothers
> some men) ... (p. 13).

**Note:** I've left out a lot of details of this study,
but I should note that the questions asked and the data
presented is as sophisticated and as meaningful as
anything done today.

**Note:** The conclusion of the article is poignant.

> The wealth and variety of writing that records the
> spiritual and intellectual adventures of all manner of
> men in all countries during all these vicissitudes is
> available for our own guidance today. It stands ready
> to explain what any one of us has enough curiosity to
> learn regarding the chances for Western civilization
> to survive. Such reading is as valuable an experience
> for any rational person as modern society has to offer
> (p. 20).
