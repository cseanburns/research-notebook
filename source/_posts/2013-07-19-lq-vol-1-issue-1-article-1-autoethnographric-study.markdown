**Preface:**

This post is part of a series of field notes on an
autoethnographic reading of [*The Library
Quarterly*](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/lq.html).
The collection can be accessed by visiting the following link:

[http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/](http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/)

For an explanation of the project, see:

**Reading and Posting Guide:**

My comments, writings, etc. begin with the term **Note**. Each new
thought begins with that term. Follow up paragraphs, if any, will
not.

My reflections will begin with the term **Reflection**. These may
usually be posted toward the end of the post, but may also be
interspersed throughout the document. I'll see how it goes.

If I am quoting a term, I may quote it within a **Note**, that is,
within my text. If I am quoting a phrase, a sentence, or something
longer, I will quote it as a block quote.

All quotes are assumed to be by the author of the paper under
investigation. If I quote another source, I will add the author's
name, year, and page number after that quote: e.g., (Author, Year,
p. n).

Because these are notes, they are not heavily edited for grammar.

This entry is about:

Williamson, C. C. (1931). The place of research in library
science. *The Library Quarterly, 1*(1), 1-17.
url:[http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039624](http://www.jstor.org/stable/40039624)

---

**Note:** The first article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "The Place of Research in Library Service." It was
written by C. C. Williamson, who was affiliated with the School of
Library Service, Columbia University.

**Note:** The author's name is listed at the end of the article and
not at the beginning.

**Note:** The article is written in first person. This may be due to
the conventions at the time, but according to the first footnote,
the article is based on a speech that was delivered in 1930. Use
of the first person could be due to that.

**Note:** A number of literary references are made at the beginning of
the article.

**Note:** The article itself is about showing the value, or convincing
young library students the value, of doing research.

**Note:** He begins with the questions, still asked today, but often
asked of him at the time:

> "What is the future of library service?" "Will it offer me a
> satisfactory career?" (p. 2).

**Note:** A point about the profession:

> Development it seems to me has been too largely of a
> quantitative rather than a qualitative character (p. 2).

**Note:** Another point about the profession, which is relevant
today, and about the increase in assistants (or perhaps,
*paraprofessionals*, although that term may be anachronistic):

> It is difficult to detect improvement in the professional status
> of the librarian. The demand for so-called trained assistants
> has increased notably in volume" (p. 3).

**Note:** He lists a number of improvements in the next few sentences,
but he ends his list with this comment about the not so great
improvements for the librarian:

> Salaries, and at the same time the prestige, of the more
> important administrative positions have increased in a
> significant way, but for the rank and file little progress seems
> to be made in remuneration and in other evidences of
> satisfactory professional status (p. 3).

**Note:** This is in agreement with what Arthur T. Hamlin (1981) wrote
about the professional status of academic librarians.
Specifically, it took 13 years after Williamson's essay for
academic librarians to gain faculty status. Hamlin wrote:

> In 1944 the University of Illinois achieved full faculty status
> and rank for all of its professional staff. It was the first
> major university to take the step. Others followed with partial
> or complete recognition in the 1950s and sixties. By the early
> seventies the majority of universities has swung over to
> recognition of most, if not all, of the professional staff as
> members of the faculty, often with faculty ranks and titles
> (Hamlin, 1981, p. 120). 

**Note:** Williamson believes that the professional status of
librarians, their prestige, is not being advanced because they are
not doing research. It doesn't seem to matter, to him, whether
that research is of a natural science kind, a social science kind,
or a humanistic kind, but simply that it is not being done.

Williamson's comment is, in a sense, in agreement with what
Hamlin, Shiflett, Carpenter, and Wiegand write. Specifically about
the culture of the primacy of knowledge creation over knowledge
dissemination. See:

Carpenter, K. E. (1996). A library historian looks at
librarianship. *Daedalus, 125*(4), 77-102.

Williamson goes on to cite a number of statistics and examples of
how and why research is important, and how quickly it is growing
in other fields. Then he notes its total absence in the library
field:

> What about research in the library field? A little sporadic work
> here and there by individuals that may possibly be classified as
> research. No organized or co-operative plans, or only the
> beginnings of such in two or three university library schools.
> No money appropriated anywhere, so far as I know, specifically
> for research in library service. Not a single person employed
> anywhere by a library or a library system to study problems of
> library service. No research fellowships. No research
> professorships (p. 5).

Then this comment that pertains to **The Library Quarterly**.
Recall that this article is essentially a reprint or a first
printing of an earlier address, which is why it mentions the
future of this publication even though it's printed in this
publication:

> One of the most hopeful indications that this condition may soon
> be remedied is the fact that the Carnegie Corporation has
> recently appropriated $25,000 to assist in starting a new
> library journal to be edited and published at the Graduate
> Library School of the University of Chicago (p. 5).

**Note:** It's interesting to think that the term **library science**
precedes the actual science of library related research:

> Not infrequently I have been pessimistic enough about this
> situation [that there is no research in the field] to wonder
> whether there is any justification for using the term "library
> science." When the new library school was started at Columbia
> four years ago we evaded the question by calling it a "school of
> library service." That there is such a thing as library service
> no one can doubt, and personally I do not doubt that it ought to
> be based on a library science, but I wish the scientific
> character of our professional activities and of our professional
> literature were more obvious" (pp. 5-6).

**Note:** Williamson notes that to do library science depends on how
science is defined. First, he refers to Frederick Barry's
**Scientific Habit of Thought**. In essence, what is important is
a **scientific attitude** based on rational investigation. Second,
He refers to John Dewey and his work **The Sources of a Science of
Education**, which argues that science is about the methods
involved and not the subject matter.

**Reflection:** Some of this discussion is based on the (now obsolete)
notion of William James' types of *men*: the tough-minded (the
scientific mind) and the tender-minded (the artistic mind). I'm
not disregarding Dewey's overall thoughts on scientific knowledge,
empirical knowledge, and so forth, just this classification as a
truthful psychological classification. Of course, although that
classification may be obsolete, it's relevant in the sense that
many may often still think of people that way, if only as an
unquestioned world-view used to judge and classify the various
roles that exist. While I am enjoying this article and think
there's a lot of good points here, Williamson adds that librarians
may be composed of people of the tender-minded sort. So his
acceptance of William James' classification is problematic. If we
reject that premise, but pursue the same end game (that of a
library science as a research science), then what new premise do
we accept?

**Note:** Interesting discussion of empirical versus scientific on
pages 7 and 8. 

> library science is purely empirical. The average librarians is
> an empiricist, not a scientist. Most administrative practices
> and technical procedures are followed because they have been
> tried somewhere and have been found to work. What psychological
> or other principles are involved is unknown (p. 8).

How has library science (or library and information science)
schools changed this? This has been examined. See, for example:

VanScoy, A. (2010). Reference librarians' personal theories of
practice: A new approach to studying reference service. In M.L.
Radford, &amp; R.D. Lankes (Eds.), *Creating the Reference
Renaissance: Current &amp; Future Trends* (pp. 115-128). New York:
Neal-Schuman. url:
[http://www.amyvanscoy.net/uploads/5/7/7/9/5779319/vanscoy_refren_chapter_6.pdf](http://www.amyvanscoy.net/uploads/5/7/7/9/5779319/vanscoy_refren_chapter_6.pdf)

**Note:** here Williamson quotes John Dewey in *How We Think*:

> Empirical inference follows the grooves and ruts that custom
> wears, and has no track to follow when the groove
> disappears....."Skill enables a man to deal with the same
> circumstances that he has met before, scientific thought enables
> him to deal with different circumstances that he has never met
> before.".... (pp. 8 - 9).

**Note:** Williamson makes an interesting turn on page 9. Let me quote
a series of statements:

> You may infer from what I have just been saying that librarians
> lack the scientific attitude, are tender-minded rather than
> tough-minded, think empirically rather than scientifically. No,
> that is not my conclusion (p. 9).

Then:

> Can it be that there are no problems in library service that
> call for scientific research? .... No .... (p. 9).

Then:

> A second possible reason that there is so little research in the
> field of library service is that if it is a science at all and
> not an art, it is only an applied science and that the necessary
> research is therefore carried on in the underlying
> sciences---psychology, social science, political science, etc.
> (pp. 9-10).

He dismisses that idea. And writes that:

> To my mind the real reason that there is so little study of the
> problems of library science is that practically no librarians
> have been trained in scientific methods (p. 10).

He adds other issues that have prevented a *library science*:
organizations are too small and a

> deep-rooted prejudice among library workers against subjecting
> their activities to scientific scrutiny (p. 10).

**Note:** that first point, that the organizations may be too small,
suggests that automation was one, although I should add not the
only, causation of library science. This is in the sense that
library automation and computerization connected libraries
together -- such that no library would henceforth exist as an
island. Think, for example, of Ralph Parker's piece:

Parker, R. H. (June 1967). The small library faces the future.
*ALA Bulletin*, 669-671.
url:[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4896241619](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4896241619)

**Note:** This sentiment has been mentioned before, particularly, I
believe, in Hamlin and Shiflett's work (mentioned above):

> We hear it said now and then by librarians of long experience
> and high position that there is not sufficient content in the
> field of library science to justify programs of study leading to
> the degree of Doctor of Philosophy or even a Master's degree (p.
> 10).

**Note:** Important to his argument -- method is primary:

> Nothing short of a lifetime is sufficient to learn all that a
> librarian needs to know! The important thing is training in
> scientific methods of attacking and solving problems, the
> cultivation of the scientific spirit and attitude. As soon as
> this is recognized and acted upon, library science will become a
> reality. Until that time librarians, no matter how many facts
> they carry in their heads, will be looked upon as clerks and
> routinists (p. 11).

Here I think of Abbott:

Abbott, A. (2004). Methods of discovery: Heuristics for the social
sciences. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.
url:[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827690286](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/827690286)

**Note:** This counters those, especially among certain higher
education administrations in the 20th century (and librarians
too), thought of libraries as simply warehouses:

> Those who see no field for research in library service or need
> of advanced training for librarianship simply fail to recognize
> the fundamental complexity of library science. To most
> librarians, as to almost all others, it presents an entirely
> false appearance of simplicity (p. 12).

**Note:** Williamson then makes a number of great points about how
other professions, i.e., psychology, sociology, statistics, etc.,
cannot do the work of library science. Although library science
may draw from these fields, its issues are its own. Those other
fields, if they were to study libraries, would, Williamson argues,
examine the issues from their perspectives, thus contributing to
the problem of [Déformation
professionnelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9formation_professionnelle),
or the "tendency to look at things from the point of view of one's
own profession," although he doesn't use that term.

**Reflection:** I've been thinking a lot lately about the problem of
*déformation professionnelle* with respect to the differences or
approaches between **library science** and **information
science**. Specifically, if a purely information scientist, that
is, someone without a background or an invested interest in
library science, recommends something for libraries, under what
conceptual framework should that be considered and how should that
be evaluated? Here I'm thinking of a recent example: when the
*altmetrics* researchers suggest something in their domain is
beneficial to librarians and their work, does the point of view of
their recommendation include what library science has deemed to be
beneficial, or is the point of view solely an information science
one, where that view has been divorced from its sibling?
Furthermore, how do librarians accept or respond to such
recommendations. See:

Lapinski, S., Piwowar, H., &amp; Priem, J. (2013 June). Riding the
crest of the almetrics wave. *College and Research Libraries News,
74*(6), 292-300.
url:[http://crln.acrl.org/content/74/6/292.full](http://crln.acrl.org/content/74/6/292.full)

So, Williamson adds:

> The psychologist cannot do the librarian's job; the sociologist
> cannot do it (p. 13).

Has information science and library science diverged so much, in
some cases at least, where we might substitute psychologist or
sociologist in Williamson's statement with information scientist?
The end point being library science can incorporate information
science theory and knowledge, but it is not itself information
science?

**Note:** Williamson then proceeds to discuss several other really
interesting issues, all of which, it seems to me, are still quite
relevant, discussed, and pursued today. I'll just mention these
things generally: the nature and problems with data collection,
what type of library science research could be undertaken, the
education of librarians where the end goal is not to make
researchers but librarians who can research, and the improvement
to library teaching as a result of a increased research. 

**Reflection**: This was a fascinating article and surely a great
introduction for *The Library Quarterly* in its inaugural issue.
I'm going to hold back, for now, on some autoethnographic
responses, but I'll get to it later, as I read more of this and
later issues. I especially want to get a sense of the character of
this first issue in order to see if there is something coherent
about it as a whole. This is important to one of the purposes of
this research project --- to understand the nature of the journal
as a collective thing (a one).
