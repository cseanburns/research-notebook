**Note:** The seventh article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Notes on Some
Scientific and Technical Libraries of Norther Europe."

It was written by H. P. Spratt, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Science Museum Library

**Note:** These are actual notes. The first paragraph explains
that what follows are simply notes the author took on a tour of
"some of the most important scientific and technical libraries of
seven nations in Northern Europe" (p. 467). Spratt writes:

> The notes which follow should therefore be accepted as an
> objective review; those who do n ot look for a philosophical
> treatise will not be disappointed (p. 467).

**Note:** Spratt describes the use of an "'Adrema' machine" that
was adapted for information retrieval. See page 476. Not much on
the general web about this device. This site outlines the use of
this device by the Nazis for documenting forced laborers:

A full description should be in the following piece, currently
head by NY Public Library:

**Note:** Author describes a really cool public library in
Stadsbiblioteket, Stockholm. Although this article is a rather
straightforward, dry description of libraries, this is rather more
lively:

> In the children's department, which is beautifully decorated and
> furnished with miniature chairs, tables, and bookshelves, there
> is the remarkable Story-Teller's Room. Seats for fifty children
> are set out in semicircular rows in front of a recess in which
> the story-teller sits and talks about fairies and "trolls" for
> an hour every afternoon. The walls are decorated with all kinds
> of fantasies, and the roof is an enormous umbrella (p. 483).

**Note:** The author speaks to a different topic, but this is, at
heart, the agenda of the time:

> to rationalize the work of the library (pp. 484-485).
