This entry is about:

Fuchs, Hermann. (1934). The "Gesamtkatalog" of the Prussian
Libraries. *The Library Quarterly, 4*(1), 36-49.

**Note:** The fourth article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
"Gesamtkatalog" of the Prussian Libraries."

It was written by Hermann Fuchs, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Staatsbibliothek

**Note:** The article is on the development of a union
catalog of most of the major libraries in Germany at the
time. It's odd reading an article like this knowing a
bit about what's happening in German in 1934 (e.g.,
Hitler was Chancellor of Germany at this time) and what
will happen in just a few years from this date.

In fact, I just did a search on Fuchs and it seems he
became a Nazi:

by [Mary Niles
Maack](http://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/maack/)

All of the sudden, this article is really hard to
read.

**Note:** In light of future developments, it's also odd
to read about American involvement in the creation of
this union catalog:

> On January 1, 1933, help arrived on a grand scale. The
> Rockefeller Foundation, in order not only to double
> the editorial staff but also to aid the participating
> libraries, granted the funds for five years which make
> it possible, though not without sacrifice, to do the
> necessary additional work (pp. 46-47).

And:

> Equally gratefully they \[the participating
> libraries\] welcome the support offered by the
> American Library Association and the Bibliographical
> Society of America in soliciting subscribers for the
> **Gesamtkatalog** in the United States (p. 47).

I don't know if anyone has pursued research on ALA's
relationship with Germany up to WWII. Needs investigation.
