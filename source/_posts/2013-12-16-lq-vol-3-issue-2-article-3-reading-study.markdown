This entry is about:

Reece, Ernest J. (1933). Work-contacts for library-school
students. *The Library Quarterly, 3*(2), 170-179.

**Note:** The third article of the second issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Work-contacts for
library-school students."

It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Columbia University

**Note:** This is not an exceptionally profound article, but it
does require some reflection. Also, this is [Reece's][1] fourth
article in *LQ*, and each article is on some aspect of library
education:

- [library school faculty][2]
- [library schools][3]
- [library school students][4]

Here's the most important question that Reece raises, and there
are parts of it that I find problematic:

> How best to supplement theoretical instruction with
> work-contacts has been the subject of much controversy in
> professional circles generally, and latterly among librarians.
> Probably most of this disputation, at least in the case of
> librarians, has been quite needless. All concerned hold that
> work-contacts and work-participation are antecedent to
> competence, and that therefore they constitute an indispensable
> element in professional participation. On the other hand, most
> doubtlessly would agree that the services of schools in
> imparting certain knowledge, attitudes, and skills are of value
> if only in the reducing of apprenticeship and in the consequent
> saving of time to the intending practitioner (p. 171).

It's that last sentence that is most troubling and yet, most
interesting.
