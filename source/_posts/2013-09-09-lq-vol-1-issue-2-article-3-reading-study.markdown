**Note:** The third article of the second issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "Children's Reading." It was written by A.
H. Starke, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Chicago, IL (No affiliation)

**Note:** This is another article on children and public
libraries. It's written in response to an early committee / study
designed to answer questions about children and reading.

Here's an interesting set of questions about the lack of
information about the topic:

> One asks in vain what part of the 47 percent of our people
> without public library service are children; how many of the two
> and a quarter million books circulated annually from our public
> libraries are juvenile books or books withdrawn for juvenile
> reading; how many of the 15,000 and more trained or experienced
> librarians in the United States are trained for, or are doing
> work with, children; what amount of the thirty-five and a third
> million dollars spend on public library work each year is spent
> on children's books, or the maintenance of children's rooms, or
> for salary of children's librarians (p. 177)?

**Note:** This article is turning out to be a really excellent
rant against the lack of information (and lack of books) about
what children get at libraries and elsewhere. 

**Note:** This rant is so good, I'm beginning to find it humorous:

> On the other hand, it seemed a little ridiculous that any
> scientific study, involving the expenditure of much time and
> often large sums of money, should present only the conclusion
> that "students of the school studied and read a great variety of
> magazines" or that "fiction seems to have a greater grip on the
> reading interests of boys and girls than reading matter of an
> informational sort"--conclusions any worker with children knows
> almost a priori to be true (p. 182).

**Note:** Even on topics of diversity, this author is remarkably
awesome and scathing of his contemporaries:

> But after considerable investigation only four studies of the
> reading interests and ability of negro children were discovered,
> and none of the reading habits and interests of children of
> other races; nor, in the many studies of children's reading, had
> the factor of face received much attention in the statements
> made concerning the home environment and the social background
> of the children studied. The aim of most investigators had been,
> apparently, to study "an even stratum of American middle-class
> life," "100 percent American" (and presumably Nordic) boys and
> girls, as if such undiluted groups anywhere exist [in the US]
> (pp. 183-184).

**Note:** Starke is not holding back on librarians now:

> As on many topics, of course, librarians could give no help at
> all (p. 185).

Ouch.

**Note:** Nice article. I don't study children's librarianship,
but it would be interesting to read and compare a contemporary
*state of the affairs* article on the topic.
