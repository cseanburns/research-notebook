**Note:** The first article of the third issue of the
third volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The
Social Science Research Council and the preservation of
source materials."

It was written by August Frederick Kuhlman, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago Libraries

**Note:** Begins with a great description (definition)
of research libraries.

> The objectives of a research library may be said to be
> twofold. From one point of view, it is an end in
> itself. Its object as a depository is to acquire,
> organize, and preserve **all** of the material of
> merit within those fields of human knowledge and
> activity that fall within its defined scope. The aim
> is to be a treasure house which in its acquisitions
> has kept abreast of the progress of those sciences
> with which it is concerned, or has even anticipated
> coming trends. It stands ready to offer the scholar
> unexplored materials with which he can make new
> discoveries and extend the bounds of knowledge. From
> another point of view, however, the research library
> is a means and not an end. Its function is one of
> mediation between the scholar's research goals and the
> sources that must be discovered, acquired, and placed
> at his disposal under favorable working conditions if
> he is to be effective. To serve either of these
> functions well, particularly the latter, presupposes
> active teamwork between scholars and librarians, for
> the building of collections represents the product of
> constantly integrating sources that are to be acquired
> and preserved with the changing and evolving research
> objectives and goals of scholars (p. 229).

**Reflection:** I read those words above and I feel as
if they are now fighting words. Those words are
inspiring. And I want to talk with people about them.

**Note:** The rest of the paragraph highlights the
important relationship between librarians and scholars
in the pursuit of social science research.

**Note:** This is an important article. Details the
history of the Social Science Research Council,
discusses some of the important work in developing
collections that would enhance social science research,
and this includes important reference works such as
*Social Science Abstracts*, and highlights the
important role that librarians had in advancing social
scientific research.
