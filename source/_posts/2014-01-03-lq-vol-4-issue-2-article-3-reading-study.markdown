**Note:** The third article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "How Norway Became the
Focus of American Library Methods in Europe."

It was written by Arne Ansteinsson, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Deichmanske Bibliotek

**Note:** Really interesting history of modern libraries in
Norway. On introducing the Dewey system:

> With regard to sixteenth- to eighteenth-century books it may
> safely be said that the introduction of D.C. was an act of
> violence (p. 151).

Next he says, in a rather nice way, that it was the best available
to them at the time.

**Note:** Note on systems of charging:

> The old charging ledgers in book form had been given up before
> his time, but he exchanged the established slip system with
> another of English origin. During a short stay in England in
> 1900 he became acquainted with the American Browne system, which
> he introduced upon his return. Some years later (1908), the
> Browne system was also abandoned on account of its slow
> operation at the delivery desk. It was replaced by the Newark
> system, which at that time was already in use in other Norwegian
> libraries (p. 151).

**Note:** Lots more on the specifics of various functions of the
library at the time. Also, details about the influence of American
libraries and library practices on Norway, including education of
librarians.
