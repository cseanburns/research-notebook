**Note:** The first article of the second issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The British Library
Association Conference."

It was written by Arundell Esdaile, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** British Museum

**Note:** The British *Library Association* is the precursor to
today's [*Chartered Institute of Library and Information
Professionals*](http://www.cilip.org.uk/).

**Note:** This is essentially a report of the conference. It
begins with a short (and nice) recent history of the libraries in
the UK.

**Note:** Interesting tidbit about library workers related to
library quality, or the view thereof:

> It is not for nothing that the great advance in serious public
> esteem of the public library in the last fifteen or twenty years
> has coincided with the raising of the standard of entry of
> junior assistants from the age of fourteen or fifteen to that of
> seventeen or eighteen, i.e., from children leaving elementary
> schools to those leaving secondary (high) schools with at least
> university matriculation (p. 100).

**Note:** Then some comments on the effects of Andrew Carnegie's
philanthropy.

**Note:** Esdaile recounts [Louis R.
Wilson](/blog/2013/10/17/lq-vol-2-issue-1-article-1-reading-study/)'s
presentation of his paper on "Aspects of education for
librarianship" (p. 101). [C. C.
Williamson](/blog/2013/07/19/lq-vol-1-issue-1-article-1-autoethnographric-study/)
is also mentioned. The author writes, in reference to what Wilson
said:

> He thought that the staffing of the great libraries needed
> scientific thinking out and that members of such staffs should
> have training in scientific research (p. 102).

**Note:** The mention of a journal I've never heard of: *Library
Association Record* (p. 102), which according to Ulrichsweb,
became *Library + Information Update* in 2002 after merging with
*Inform*. This of course corresponds to the merging of the
*Library Association* with the *Institute of Information
Scientists* in 2002.

[W. W.
Bishop](/blog/2013/09/11/lq-vol-1-issue-3-article-1-reading-study/)
is also mentioned, in reference to a pre-conference *International
Federation of Library Associations* (IFLA) meeting.

**Note:** Wilson, Williamson, and Bishop represent connections as
previous, early authors of *LQ*. This could be why Esdaile is
familiar with *The Library Quarterly* (and is publishing in it).
In fact, Esdaile attended the IFLA meeting that Wilson and Bishop
attended (the latter becoming IFLA's second president). It's
currently unknown, to me, how well disseminated *LQ* was at this
time, only half way through its second volume. The conference took
place in August 1931 and there is no submission date attached to
this piece. Esdaile was elected as an IFLA vice-president along
with Marcel Godet, who became IFLA's third president, and Bishop
who became the second president. Quick IFLA past president info

**Reflection:** I didn't expect to get so much out of this
article.
