**Note:** The fifth article of the fourth issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Maya Books and
Sciences."

It was written by Frans Blom, who were affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Tulane University

**Note:** *LQ*'s scope at this time was certainly interesting.
This article discusses the Mayans and the Aztecs and the state of
knowledge of these two cultures at the time. Also, it discusses,
in some detail, the writing and the mathematical abilities of the
Mayans. Blom is highly enthusiastic about these cultures.

Regarding *LQ*, this is not the first article that is somewhat
outside the modern *library* box. Others, historical and
international, include:

- Mackensen and ["Four Great Libraries of Medieval Baghdad"][1]
- Cr√ºwell and ["Contributions to Egyptian Penmanship"][2]

[Frans Blom][3], the author, seems to have had an interesting
history.
