**Note:** The fifth article of the third issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled  "Reading Studies Contributory to Social
Sciences."

It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** Just based on the title, I'm beginning to see an agenda
here. I've long known that the Graduate Library School sought to
make a social science of library studies (thus, library science).
This seems fairly evident in the articles the GLS faculty are
publishing in this first volume of *LQ*.

**Reflection:** In many ways, reading these early issues sometimes
doesn't feel like I'm reading articles that were published more
than 80 years ago. For example, this article is about the
interdisciplinary nature of library science as well as cooperative
research. I've been reading about this topic recently and the
arguments are much the same.

Should I be expecting change? Should things be very different than
they were 80 years ago?

Part of the answer lies in the fact that these articles were
written in a time that I believe introduces the age that library
science functions today, in a paradigmatic kind of way. So that,
we're simply still operating under the same assumptions and
frameworks and with many of the same problems as they were in
1931. Despite all the change, it really hasn't changed all that
much. 

Also, and in this particular paper, what I'm reading about is
reflective of what Robert K. Merton writes about. That is,
problems of cooperative research are very much problems with the
entire ethos of science, which hasn't changed either.

**Note:** The next part of the paper illustrates examples that
involve what could be useful to both sociology and library
science, and the specific examples concern the public and reading.
A good amount of research has been done in this area, in
subsequent years, but the questions Waples raises are still
relevant.

**Note:** Example of cooperative research Waples proposes:

> Since no reliable evidence on the status of reading within any
> given adult publication has yet been produced, we have here a
> field of investigation in which the student of reading and the
> sociologist should co-operate to mutual advantage (p. 296).

**Note:** Waples mentions pre-testing and post-testing in research
(he doesn't use those terms though). I just find that interesting,
since it makes me aware that I don't know how long (social)
scientists have pre and post-tested:

> The [Thurstone
> scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurstone_scale) for the
> measurement of attitudes toward various current issues might be
> readily applied before and after the reading of a given book or
> article to secure such evidence (p. 297).

**Note:** Waples ends the article with an outline of the four
types of reading studies that he just illustrated and discussed in
the article. The outline includes the research problems that need
to be addressed and a brief description of how to measure those
problems, where appropriate. It's a nice list.
