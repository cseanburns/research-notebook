**Note:** The sixth article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Libraries of the
London Coffeehouses."

It was written George S. McCue, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** No Affiliation (New York City)

**Note:** Right away, the first sentence reminds me of an article
written by [Robert Darnton][1]:

> The London coffeehouses of Dryden's time had a great deal to do
> with the dissemination of the printed page (p. 624).

Darnton, R. (2000). An early information society: News and the
media in eighteenth-century Paris. *The American Historical
Review, 105*(1), 1-35.
doi:[10.2307/2652433](http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2652433)

**Note:** Books (libraries) in coffee houses goes back centuries.
The reference to one here is to the year 1694. Another reference
to one in 1668.

**Note:** The author describes how publishers were really against
lending libraries. Ah publishers.

**Note:** Really nice, short history of these early types of
libraries. Good addition to any world library history reading
list.
