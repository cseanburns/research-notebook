**Preface:**

This post is part of a series of field notes on an
autoethnographic reading of [*The Library
Quarterly*](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/journals/journal/lq.html).
The collection can be accessed by visiting the following link:

[http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/](http://sweb.uky.edu/~csbu225/blog/categories/lq-autoethno-field-notes/)

For an explanation of the project, see:

**Reading and Posting Guide:**

My comments, writings, etc. begin with the term **Note**. Each new
thought begins with that term. Follow up paragraphs, if any, will
not.

My reflections will begin with the term **Reflection**. These may
usually be posted toward the end of the post, but may also be
interspersed throughout the document. I'll see how it goes.

If I am quoting a term, I may quote it within a **Note**, that is,
within my text. If I am quoting a phrase, a sentence, or something
longer, I will quote it as a block quote.

All quotes are assumed to be by the author of the paper under
investigation. If I quote another source, I will add the author's
name, year, and page number after that quote: e.g., (Author, Year,
p. n).

Because these are notes, they are not heavily edited for grammar.

This entry is about:

Reece, Ernest J. (1931). "The Service Loads of Library-School
Faculties." *The Library Quarterly, 1*(1), 37-56.

**Note:** The fifth article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "The Service Loads of Library-School Faculties." It was
written by Ernest J. Reese, who was writing on behalf of the
*Committee on Teaching Loads in Library Schools*, a committee of
the Association of American Library Schools (now ALISE), and who
was affiliated with The School of Library Service, Columbia
University. The article, according to the first footnote, is based
on an earlier report given to the Association.

**Note:** I'm not sure, yet, if I'll have much to say about this
piece. It's a report about the hours instructors spend on various
duties related to teaching and instruction as well as various
other non-course duties or activities. It's an interesting piece,
for historical reasons and, also, because in many ways it seems
not much has changed. I suppose it was an important piece at the
time, given the relative newness of library schools and a need to
understand the norms.

**Note:** One interesting, superficial bit is the way
distributions are conveyed in the time before computers. The
distributions are displayed in tables, with the mean of the
numbers in the top row, per the count of the numbers in the second
row. It's a fairly informative method of conveying the details.
Both overall means and medians are provided, which is nice.
Medians are too often left out of statistical reporting today.

**Note:** It seems, according to Table V in the article, that most
instructors spent about a half hour revising student work in one
of the courses. Good to know!

**Note:** The courses covered include:

- Library administration
- Library routines
- Reference books and work; bibliography
- Book selection
- Cataloguing
- Classification

**Note:** The second section covers data on non-course
activities. As listed on pages 46-47 include:

- care for student welfare
- oversight of field work
- editing of school publications
- preparation of exhibits
- attendance at school social functions
- official participation in general activities of institutions
  which which schools are connected, e.g., universities and
  library commissions (pp. 46-47).

**Note:** Per Table XIV on page 47, the "time per week spent in
non-course activities": *n* = 47, *m* = 10.24, and *mdn* = 9.37
(p. 47).

**Note:** Interesting quote about how the data can be used to
assess instructors' working loads. Key words or ideas that stick
out to me include: health, work environment (physical conditions),
scholarly and professional demands, wise decisions.

> Also, the health of individuals, the physical conditions under
> which they must work, the demands pressing upon them because of
> their professional records, all may influence vitally the effort
> to reach wise decisions in particular cases. A teacher's service
> program is obviously not a think to which time-clock methods can
> be applied (p. 48).

And this quote, as far as applying the data to specific
individuals:

> The case may be taken of an instructor believed to occupy a
> middle rather than an extreme position as to speed and
> experience, who is in good though not robust health, who works
> steadily but without tension or excess, who has taught a variety
> of subjects, and to suit whose abilities some reallocation of
> existing assignments can be considered (p. 48).

**Note:** The next part is very interesting, as the author
suggests the number of hours, based on the medians reported in the
earlier part of the paper and other numbers including class size,
that could be devoted to each course per week (esp. for new
instructors who haven't built up experience or materials to draw
from). They include, for one section courses (although numbers are
often given for courses taught in two sections):

- Library administration: 9.18 hours per week
- Library routines: 5.38 hours per week
- Reference books and work: 13 hours per week
- Classification: 23.25 hours per week
- Non-course activities: 9.37 hours per week (pp. 49-50).

There are a number of caveats and exceptions in the above numbers.
Reece, for example, offers numbers based on deductions for time
spent by assistants and for other reasons. 

**Note:** The article ends with two appendices, though they are
not labeled as such. The first is a copy of the letter sent to
faculty requesting their participation in the study. The second is
the handout given to faculty and that was used to collect the
data.

**Note:** While I wrote above that not much has changed---one key
difference between then and now is that this article reflects a
point in time when instructors in library schools were not
overwhelmingly PhDs, and so this report does not take into
consideration the amount of time needed to do research.

**Reflection:** Although it's a report and not a scientific study,
this is the first data driven article in the *LQ*. I am not, as of
yet, being very autoethnographic in my field notes, and I'll have
to say something about that in a future post. I'm taking this time
as a period of figuring things out.
