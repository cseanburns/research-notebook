**Note:** The third article of the second issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Interlibrary Loan in
College and University Libraries."

It was written by Kenneth J. Boyer, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Bowdoin College

**Note:** A survey of libraries about their interlibrary loan
practices.

**Note:** Interlibrary loaning is one area where libraries have
truly progressed, at least in practice, and the advancement in
this area is partially due to the ease of fulfilling these
requests (the available infrastructure, broadly envisioned).

Although I have experienced a library denying a request of mine
(it is rare), I cannot imagine that it would be acceptable as a
matter of routine today:

> To be sure, we restricted our own requests to books for use in
> serious research; only once did we attempt to borrow a book for
> an undergraduate, an exceptional case in which the student was
> doing what amounted to Master's degree research (even then we
> were refused the loan) (p. 113).

Notice, also, the level of expectation and the level of regulation
or gatekeeping in the above passage. The librarian neither expects
to receive a request nor to fulfill a request. Further, requests
are only really considered in matters of *serious research.* This
meant that the librarian had to make a judgement call about the
*seriousness* of the patron's needs and that there existed a kind
of a decision rule with regards to undergraduates --- that their
information needs will rarely be greater than the cost to request
a loan from another library.

Given this, however, the purpose of this article involves finding
a way to progress in this matter---to give more attention to the
information needs of all patrons. I know a little of this history,
but it would be worthwhile to investigate more deeply---to see
what documentation existed that discussed this matter.

**Reflection:** There is in this article a really important lesson
about information expectations. We expect it to be free and
quickly accessible today. Tracing these expectations, from a
history of ideas perspective, would be an important research
topic.

**Note:** Two important statements and several important
implications in this passage:

> One library reported that in certain cases faculty members and
> graduate students are enabled to visit other libraries by a fund
> provided for that purpose. 

And the rest of the paragraph and second important statement:

> One southern college for negroes reported that they borrowed
> freely, "as libraries in the South are not always open to
> us"---which tells its own story (p. 120).

**Note:** On privacy:

> Only 19 (9.3 per cent) replied that they required the name of
> the reader for whom the material was borrowed, while 167 (82.2
> per cent) answered that they did not do so (p. 121).

**Note:** On the use of union catalogs:

> Borrowers are now better able to learn where their books may be
> obtained; the **Union list of serials** definitely locates
> periodical holdings, and requests for these may be diversified;
> some localities have regional union lists of serials; there are
> certain printed aids showing the location of books in special
> fields (p. 123).

**Note:** On the accessibility of information. There is an
important relationship here between accessibility and expectations
(see note above):

> Consider for a moment the predicament of a library in New
> England with one of its books lent to a California library. The
> book is needed at home and must be recalled. A letter sent by
> regular mail would take five days to reach the California
> library; air mail would take about two and one-half days. One
> day would be lost in calling in the book and preparing it for
> mailing, and the return trip would take not less than seven
> days, usually more. This would mean a minimum of ten or eleven
> days and a maximum of fourteen or more. Meanwhile the local
> borrower must wait, usually not patiently. Or, for example, a
> book is absent from a library on the East coast for ten days to
> two weeks longer when it is lent to a library on the West coast
> than it is if it is lent anywhere in the adjoining states or
> even slightly farther way (p. 123).

The beginning of the next paragraph:

> Nevertheless, it is to the everlasting credit of American
> college libraries that 139 (68.4 per cent) reported that they
> either lend, or would lend if asked, books and periodicals to
> libraries at a great distance from their own (p. 123).

**Note:** Although libraries overall seemed to suffer from few
losses, it did occur and mostly seemed to happen in relation to
the postal service. So this is kind of funny::

> Nevertheless, there are losses, and it behooves each library to
> be as careful as possible. Several libraries reported that they
> did not ship books during the Christmas season, which is a wise
> precaution (p. 128).

**Note:** Who pays for interlibrary loans? The author didn't ask
this question but he writes that, fortunately, some libraries
provided this anyway. A couple more interesting scenarios:

> 1 library reported that professors paid the charges one way and
> that students paid all charges (p. 129).

And:

> One library, which originally paid all charges for the
> professors, made a change in its policy two years ago, requiring
> the professors to pay all charges; as a result there was a
> noticeable decrease in requests to borrow (p. 129).

**Note:** They weren't always a fan of interlibrary loans, as one
librarian wrote in:

> Consumes much valuable time. It proves to be a costly practice
> in many ways" (p. 130).

**Note:** Still an important consideration for any school that
builds a new program:

> There is the problem of the college or university giving
> graduate work without the necessary library equipment to care
> adequately for the needs of its graduate students (p. 130).

**Note:** Article ends with a letter about a statewide cooperative
plan. Important ending and an important topic, one that would
eventually shape the future of library administration.
