**Note:** The eighteenth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Anonymous Classic
and Some Problems of Its Cataloging."

It was written by Harriet Dorothea MacPherson, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Columbia University

**Note:** Quite a delightful read about cataloging anonymous
works; issues include: the selection of main or added entry, state
of knowledge with historical and literary scholarship on
authorship of texts, the nature of texts (e.g., epics, fairy
tales), and so forth.
