**Note:** The eighth article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "College Literary
Societies in the Fifties."

It was written by Guy R. Lyle, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Antioch College Library

**Note:** A very lively depiction of college literary societies in
the 1850s. As noted in either [Hamlin][1] or [Shiflett][2] or both
(as well as others), the libraries these societies built would
become important contributions to academic libraries later in the
19th and early in the 20th centuries.
