**Note:** The seventh article published in *The Library Quarterly*
is titled "Three Hundred Days in Roman Libraries." It was authored
by Geneva Drinkwater, who was affiliated with the University of
Chicago.

**Note:** This is a very delightful account about, as the title
suggests, a trip to Roman libraries. It begins with a trip to the
"Santa Scolastica in Subiaco," a monastery where St. Benedict
lived, and ends at the Vatican library. Although very brief, the
piece is a wonderful description of Geneva Drinkwater's experience
oversees. There are few descriptions of the libraries, but that's
not the focus.

Perhaps because I was intrigued by the name, I did a quick web
search for Geneva Drinkwater and have discovered that this is the
kind of person who makes good history (read her bio below).
Actually, it's a nice reminder that behind every paper I read,
there's a person. That may seem obvious, but it's easy to read
papers without thinking about the author. That's, actually, part
of the point with scientific authorship. I'd have to look it up,
but I think that point was made by either Robert K. Merton or
Derek J. de Solla Price.

Here are a couple of brief biographies and the second link
contains a link to an oral history that she is reading:

I was quite happy to discover that Drinkwater and I both went to
school at the same place (University of Missouri) and worked at
the same place (Stephens College).

**Note:** Study update: I'm altering the name of the title of
these posts from Autoethnographic Study to Reading Study. The
reason is that these readings will be useful for other purposes.
