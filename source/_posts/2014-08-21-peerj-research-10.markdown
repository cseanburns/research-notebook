On [August 20, 2013](/blog/2013/08/20/peerj-research-2/) I collected a round of
data based on a sample of random numbers generated on [July 20,
2013](/blog/2013/07/20/peerj-research/).

On [November 20, 2013](/blog/2013/11/20/peerj-research-7/) I collected a follow
up round of data plus some additional data points.

On [February 20, 2014](/blog/2013/11/20/peerj-research-8/) , I collected an
additional round of data and added some additional data points.

On [May 20, 2014](/blog/2013/11/20/peerj-research-9/), I collected what I
thought would be the final round of data. However, after exploring the data I
decided that a better picture of the growth of this journal's first year would
require one more round of data in order to have four intervals to examine, or a
full year's worth of changes. The intervals are:

- Interval 1: Aug 20, 2013 to Nov 20, 2013
- Interval 2: Nov 20, 2013 to Feb 20, 2014
- Interval 3: Feb 20, 2014 to May 20, 2014
- Interval 4: May 20, 2014 to Aug 20, 2014

What I'll likely do is continue collecting data on this sample in order to have
a long run view of the changes.

Today, on August 20, 2014, I collected the fifth round of data. No additional
data points were added.

Currently, the data is stored in a LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet file and is
exported to a CSV file for analysis with R using R Studio.

The variables are the same as that which is listed in the entry on [May 20,
2014](/blog/2013/11/20/peerj-research-9/). That entry has been updated over the
last few months. See that post for a description of each variable. I'll add
descriptive quantitative information in a new post shortly.
