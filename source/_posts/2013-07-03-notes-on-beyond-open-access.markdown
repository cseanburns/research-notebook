This is a very nice piece on the theory of open access, and in
relation to scholarly communication, in particular:

Tatum, C., &amp; Jankowski, N. W. (2013). Beyond open access: A
framework for openness in scholarly communication. In P. Wouters,
A. Beaulieu, A. Scharnhorst, &amp; S. Wyatt (Eds.), [Virtual
Knowledge: Experimenting in the Humanities and the Social
Sciences](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/792941486) (pp. 183--218).
Cambridge: MIT Press.

Some notes:  

---  

On the three elements used to analyze scholarly openness, but also
on any aspect of the interaction of these (important theoretical
point):

> As such, analytical focus is aimed at interaction among human
> agency, social structure in the form of situated practices, and
> material structure in the form of digital media. Following
> Orlikowski, we view technology as "both an enabler of, and a
> constraint on, human action" (Orlikowski 1992, 25) (p. 194).

At the end of the chapter, the authors write:

> The openness framework developed in this chapter provides an
> analytical lens for developing a better understanding of
> informal communication practice. Introduction of this framework
> is intended to facilitate future development of a theory of
> openness in scholarly communication, one that will address new
> questions informed by emerging scholarly practices (p. 214).

This chapter fulfills its promise, as stated in the above passage.
I will be able to use the framework by integrating it within the
research I started in my dissertation.

Something I've never fully considered as a problem with openness.
In some open access journals, hyperlinking is employed within the
text (i.e., for within text navigation) and is not often used to
link to other documents on the web (e.g., those journals that do
not employ the use of DOI linking). The problem, as Tatum and
Jankowski note, is that,

> This example shows how publishers selectively employ
> technological affordances in ways that limit the degree of
> openness (p. 202).

On within article prioritization --- this has important
implications for **reading** (here I'm thinking of [Walter
Ong](http://www.citeulike.org/user/seancsb/article/12459040), and
also will impact perceptions of information --- as atomic rather
than interrelated.

> The new format directs reader attention to specific components
> of an article rather than an all-encompassing presentation or
> argument [.... and] away from the traditional linear structure
> of the scholarly journal article to an almost postmodern
> conception of the article emphasizing visual, multiple modes of
> presentation and online dynamic updating (p. 203).

An important note on the role of blogs (and other genres) as
informal uses of scholarly communication:

> Being the first person to present findings or to make
> particular claims on a blog does not formally register
> intellectual priority, as would be the case in a journal
> publication, but it does provide a sounding board among peers
> (p. 208).

This has ramifications for various metrics and for those who are
interested in using blogs for more mainstream scholarly
communication. However, if a scholarly community decided that
blogs could be used to formally register intellectual priority,
then blogs can be used in such a way. But a blog operated by a
person, without *checks and balances* so to speak, is problematic.
Previous entries can be edited so that intellectual priority can
be claimed. This could be problematic. Surely, sites such as the
[Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/) might help, but I still
think it could be a substantial issue, even if rare.

In regards to books and open peer review --- this certainly has
implications for authorship as well:

> If the open peer review process is used exclusively in
> preparation of the final version, it isn't clear what sort of
> academic certification and recognition the primary author and
> the publisher can grant (p. 213).

So far, based on the references used in this chapter, I should
read the following works:

Orlikowski, Wanda. 1992. The duality of technology: Rethinking the
concept of technology in organizations. *Organization Science*
3(3): 398--427. URL:

**Other news**: I'm happy to announce that the program committee
of the [Association for Information Science &amp;
Technology](http://asis.org/) accepted our panel presentation for
the upcoming 2013 conference in Montreal. The title of the panel
is *High-Stakes Information: Deciding What Constitutes Quality in
Our Products of Communication*. My role in the panel will be to
present some on-going research on peer review, with respect to
[*PeerJ*](https://peerj.com/), and to raise questions about peer
review in general.

The other two panelists and their parts include: Dr. John Budd
will talk about what scholars take to be criteria for quality of
information within scholarly literature. [Dr. Heather
Moulaison](http://www.moulaison.net/) will speak to issues with
metadata standards and describing information.

This is my first panel and I'm looking forward to the discussion
it generates. I have quite a few questions to raise.
