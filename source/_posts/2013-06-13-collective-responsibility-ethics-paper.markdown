Now that the dissertation is done, this past month I've been catching up
on some side projects I started while in the doctoral program. Last week
I submitted my history research paper to a journal. Yesterday I came
back to the ethics paper I've been working on with Matt Altman. Should
be able to finish that and send it off to a journal by the middle of
July.

The ethics paper does not address any specific moral or ethical dilemma
and does not commit to any ethical theory. Rather, the research focuses
on some assumptions in ethics -- assumptions about agency and action --
and addresses these assumptions within the field of library and
information science. The research was inspired by a philosophy course I
took on collective action.

I have some other work ahead of me for the summer. I submitted my
dissertation to an editor for review. Should hear back on that by next
month. I plan on submitting a couple proposals to ALISE. Those are both
due by the middle of July. More details on those later -- specifically
on one of them, as I plan to use this site to keep extensive research
notes for it.

More later.
