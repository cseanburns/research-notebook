**Note:** The seventh article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Further Notes on
Scientific and Technical Libraries in Northern Europe."

It was written H. P. Spratt, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Science Museum Library

**Note:** This a continuation of this article:

[Spratt, 1934a](/blog/2014/01/14/lq-vol-4-issue-3-article-7-reading-study/)

**Note:** The article begins by describing libraries in Warsaw,
Poland.

At the "*Bibljoteka Publiczna (Public Library), Warszawa*, the
author writes something about a school and a library collection on
librarianship:

> There is a special "library of librarianship" with a collection
> of 3,000 volumes, so comprehensive that even some of the present
> writer's articles are to be found there (if looked for).
> Finally, I was shown the school of librarianship, where students
> learn the use of decimal classification and so forth (p. 630).

**Note:** After describing a number of libraries in Poland, the
author moves on to libraries in Helsinki and then to Russia.

**Note:** Just kind of interesting -- about the "*Central Transport
Library, Leningrad*":

> It is of interest to mention that, in more than a hundred years,
> there have only been four successive librarians (p. 635).
