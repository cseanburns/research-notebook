**Note:** The first article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Plea for a Philosophy
of Librarianship: Philosophia vero omnium mater artium."

It was written by J. Periam Danton, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** This is probably the most cited article from these first
few volumes.

**Note:** Equates librarianship with library science by applying
one definition to the two terms:

> Librarianship or library science is that branch of learning
> which has to do with the recognition, collection, organization,
> preservation, and utilization of graphic and printed records
> (pp. 528-529).

**Note:** First reference to Ranganathan's *Five laws of library
science*. Danton writes:

> But this treatise, as stimulating and interesting as it
> undoubtedly is, does not attempt to define the functions of
> library activity on any other bases than that of present-day
> good library service; ... (p. 532).

So it's interesting that S. R. Ranganathan's book had sparked some
discussions at this early of a date.

**Note:** A one sentence summary of Danton's criticism:

> The crux of the matter is that the librarian has thus far
> concerned himself almost exclusively with process, achievement,
> and the immediate objective, and has given little or no thought
> to function or to justifying that function (p. 533).

**Note:** Danton addresses my above remark:

> The term "librarianship" may be said to be equivalent to
> "library science" (p. 535).

**Note:** On science and philosophy (important to note for, at the
very least, having a historical understanding of their use of the
terms):

> Any science deals fundamentally with the acquisition of facts
> and data; the description of those data through definition,
> analysis, and classification; explanation of them by the
> ascertainment of causes; and, finally, evaluation and the
> formulation of laws. Science concerns itself directly with
> concrete phenomena. A philosophy, on the other hand, is
> interested in aims and functions, in purpose and meaning (pp.
> 535-536).

**Note:** The aesthetic factor:

> In contrast, although a philosophy of librarianship would be
> vitally interested, indirectly, in the scientifically derived
> data on reading interests, abilities, etc., it would be
> primarily concerned with purpose---that is, with finding out
> whether librarianship should concern itself with the question at
> all, and if so why... (p. 536).

**Reflection:** It's too often ignored --- that science without
philosophy and philosophy without science is impossible. To
pretend that the relationship does not exist is, also, dangerous.

**Note:** I'm taking this out of context but I think it's an
important example of what Danton thinks is an instance of the
science of librarianship in practice. The preceding sentences, not
quoted here, are important in that they reference some of the
authors that have dominated these early volumes of *LQ*:

> It should be noted, too, that one phase of library work---is, in
> a not very different sense, scientific in its approach and
> techniques. This is enumerative bibliography which, at its best,
> is the examination, description, and listing of books in
> accordance with certain well-defined principles and by means of
> a more or less universally accepted terminology (p. 538).

**Note:** Beginning at the top of page 540, good criticism on the
lack of interest in libraries by sociologists, political
scientists, etc. Need to come back to this someday. Interesting /
respectful quote by a Wesley C. Mitchell that responds to this
lack of treatment and attention.

Danton, though, soundly rejects Mitchell's argument.

**Note:** More aesthetic. See Danton's concrete example at the top
of page 544.

**Reflection:** The *LQ* pushes the library science in the first
volumes, and now pushes the philosophy of library science.

**Reflection:** I should have reread this article before I
submitted my Parker piece. The discussion about isolation in the
first paragraph of section 6 on page 546 would have been useful to
add.

**Note:** Important discussion about the necessity of libraries on
pages 548-549. They may or may not be, Danton seems to argue, but
if we state they are, then that statement needs to be justified
and not simply taken as an ideological presupposition.
