**Note:** The third article of the first issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Relation of
Subject Interests to Actual Reading."

It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** There are only three articles in this issue, but the
articles are quite lengthy. The remaining issues for this volume
have about five or six articles each.

**Note:** This is the fourth article by Douglas Waples. He had
articles published in the first three issues of the first volume
and now the first issue of the second volume.

**Note:** Waples, if I recall from past readings of his work,
continues to push the idea that other disciplines (e.g.,
education, political science, etc.) will find library science
research relevant and fruitful for their own work. He does so
explicitly but also by stating that LS research is not just
"technical":

> If it be assumed that the reading desired by a group is both
> authentic and important, the investigation may also be
> significant for educators, political scientists, and students of
> social welfare. Hence the work herein reported should not be
> regarded as of merely technical interest (p. 42).

**Note:** Nice outline of the "conditions affecting satisfaction
in reading" (p. 44). He uses the propositions in this outline to
ask the following research question (so to speak):

> How may one proceed to increase the satisfactions obtainable
> from reading (p. 45)?

And his method is very analytical, well-described, and even
pedagogical (which might be purposeful):

> The answer we propose has three parts. First, we can separate
> the conditions that can *not* be directly controlled, such as
> the reader's desire to read on particular subjects, from the
> conditions that *can* be controlled to some extend, such as the
> appeal of the reading matter itself and its accessibility (p.
> 45).

Then:

> Second, we can find out for each of several typical groups of
> readers what sort of reading is defined by the conditions that
> cannot be controlled (p. 45).

Last:

> Third, we can modify certain other conditions to whatever extent
> is needed in order (*a*) to increase the supply of reading that
> meets the indicated demand and (*b*) to make it more accessible
> (p. 45).

**Note:** The conditions Waples believes are the most relevant to
reading satisfaction:

> What is practicable, however, is a possibility rendered
> plausible by data presented in this report; namely, that three
> of the conditions mentioned are so much more influential than
> other conditions in their effects upon the satisfaction obtained
> from actual reading that the others may be disregarded for
> practical purposes (p. 46).

Then:

> These conditions, for the general reader, are probably subject
> interest, readability, and accessibility (p. 46).

And why these conditions are also important for research and
practicing purposes:

> All three may in time be sufficiently controlled to increase
> very considerably the amount of satisfactory literature
> available to various populations. That is to say, the material
> on the preferred subjects can be increased in amount, its
> methods of treatment can be better adjusted to the given
> readers, and it can be more widely advertised (p. 46).

And why (and a sort of prediction that he makes):

> Such measures would increase the readers' satisfaction, since
> the correspondence between the subjects of most interest and the
> subjects most read about becomes close when the actual reading
> is reduced to material which (1) includes the given subjects,
> (2) is attractively written, and (3) is easily accessible (p.
> 46).

**Note:** The next section is titled **PROCEDURE**. I'd have to go
back and look but I'm fairly confident that this is the first
instance of a clearly defined methods section. I do remember that
previous *LQ* articles did have ill-defined sections or parts that
described the methods used but not as explicitly as this.

**Note:** Waples begins by repeating his research question:

> With so much by way of perspective, we may attack the central
> question---What is the relation of actual reading to subject
> interest? In other words, to what **extent** is the reading done
> by a typical group of adults concerned with subjects upon which
> the group expresses most desire to read \[emphasis added\] (p.
> 46)?

Then Waples succinctly describes how he will answer this question:

> To answer this question it is necessary, first, to discover what
> subjects are interesting and uninteresting as such; then, to
> determine how much material is actually read upon each subject;
> and, finally, to make the comparison (pp. 46-47).

Then he ends the paragraph with a nod to a **FINDINGS** section
(it begins on page 55). This signifies to me that it is his intent
to title his sections so explicitly. This marks an explicit turn
in the literature---a marked change in the evolution of library
studies as a *library science*:

> The three steps will be discussed in turn to explain the method
> of procedure. The section on "findings" presents the evidence
> (p. 47).

It will be interesting to note how long it takes before this
literary turn takes off in future articles.

In any case, this is an important step in the literature.

**Note:** The first thing Waples does in the procedure section is
list a number of possible ways to answer his research question,
but point by point he points out their deficiencies. He then makes
the case that although any one method may be deficient (or
impractical), a combination of these methods may result in valid
findings. He rejects a couple of the methods, and uses a
combination of three others.

**Note:** The purpose here is not necessarily to comment on any
findings, but here's something I think is interesting, mostly
because it's still somewhat the case today, although it may play
out in various channels:

> Of the fiction read by men and women combined, it was possible
> to identify the authors of 186 titles. Of these, 55 were
> sensational stories of the news stand variety that would
> scarcely appear on public-library shelves (p. 63).

Also, Waples lists the 19 non-fiction titles on pages 63--64.
Fascinating list. I'd like to know how many of those books were
passed back and forth among the readers.

**Reflection:** Waples' material continues to be interesting
reading. I will need to investigate whether this is the first
instance of **PROCEDURE** and **FINDINGS** sections.
