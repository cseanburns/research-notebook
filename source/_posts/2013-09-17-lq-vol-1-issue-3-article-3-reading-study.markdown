Library Movement. *The
Library Quarterly, 1*(3), 278-282.

**Note:** The third article of the third issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "The Sociological Beginnings of the Library
Movement."

It was written by Arnold K. Borden, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Dartmouth College

**Note:** This is the kind of article I'm really interested in
reading. First off, though, is a citation to a book that I have
read about and have seen references to in past studies and in this
one. It happens to be available from
[archive.org](http://archive.org). It is:

William S. Learned. (1924). *[The American Public Library and the
Diffusion of
Knowledge](http://archive.org/details/americanpublicli007473mbp)*.
New York: Harcourt, Brace and Company.

Borden has this to say about the Learned book:

> From a strictly contemporary point of view the sociological
> study by W. S. Learned is illuminating but does not aim to be
> retrospective (p. 278).

**Note:** Borden begins by noting the failure, up to that time, of
librarians or others in studying the beginnings of public
libraries. He writes:

> Although next to the public-school system and the press the
> library exercises the greatest educative influence in the state,
> it rarely appears to be given much weight in the deliberation of
> sociologists and political scientists (p. 278).

I believe [Andrew Abbott](http://home.uchicago.edu/aabbott/) has
made that same criticism in regards to his own field's lack of
attention on libraries.

Also, I believe the development of *library science* was partially
a response to the lack of inquiry that existed in this area. Under
this view, *library science* is interpreted as a kind of political
science or sociology of libraries.

**Note:** This is true and a very important point:

> In 1850 there were about 100 libraries of 5,000 or more volumes
> or more aggregating something like 1,000,000 volumes. In 1890
> there were 4,000 libraries containing 27,000,000 volumes. In
> this period the first library convention was held (1853), and
> the American Library Association, the State School at Albany,
> and the *Library Journal* were founded. Surely the causes for
> this phenomenal growth must lie sufficiently deep to call for
> more than superficial investigation (pp. 278-279).

I wonder if library science, as a field, can support a sort of
library history as well as a [cliometric-style library
history](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/525290504) in the form of
specific departments dedicated to this area of inquiry.

Regarding the 1853 conference, this is an important book (I read
about a year ago):

Utley, George Burwell. *The librarians' conference of 1853, a
chapter in American library history.* Chicago: American Library
Association, 1951. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370309](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1370309)

The cliometric link above refers to (I've read parts of this):

McMullen, Haynes. (2000). *American Libraries before 1876*.
Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2000.

**Note:** An explanation has been sought. While I have an
understanding of what has been researched in this area, I'll just
note that this is one of the most highly cited articles in my
study so far.

> But when one has reviewed all the accomplishments of government
> and individuals, the reasons behind the rapid library expansion
> in the latter half of the nineteenth century remain unexplained
> (p . 280).

**Reflection:** When I begin analyzing my data for this study
(using these field note entries), I should make note of which
articles I've commented on the most and classify those articles by
whatever type emerges. I think this will say something about what
I am trying to discover in this study. (Wow, a lot of
reflexivity!)

**Note:** Important note about the relationship between public
schools and public libraries, and the view of public libraries as
an extension of public schools:

> In the first place the library movement was intimately
> associated with the establishment of free public schools.
> Logically, it would seem that the public school was a necessary
> prelude to the library, that a body of people capable of reading
> must be created before the library could perform a significant
> function in the community (p. 280).

Imagine closely reading these *LQ* issues at the times they were
published and received by the readers. This article, followed by
the article on *The Public Library under the City-Manager Form of
Government*, pair well. That is, together they lead to a broader
understanding of, for example, why some early public libraries
were attached to school districts rather than to city governments.
I commented on that article
[here](/blog/2013/08/28/lq-vol-1-issue-2-article-1-reading-study/).

**Note:** Here the library is seen not necessary as a mechanism to
advance democracy by the government but as a mechanism to advance
democracy by an already democratic people. The view, seems to be,
that creating public libraries can be understood as a type of
survival and growth mechanism. (I'm aware that my use of the term
**mechanism** may not be the most appropriate.):

> Another antecedent condition favoring the growth of public
> libraries was the increased voting strength of the people (p.
> 281).

**Note:** Leisure and libraries. Here we have the problem that
there are now many ways to go about leisure. Thus the public
library, today, is in competition with other leisurely providing
entities:

> Attendant upon the increase of wealth resulting from the
> establishment of the factory system and the exploitation of the
> natural resources of the country was the increase of leisure
> demanded by labor (p. 281).

**Note:** This is a great line:

> Students of library history, therefore, must not look upon the
> library as an isolated phenomenon or as something which has been
> struck off the brains of individuals in moments of philanthropic
> zeal (p. 282).

He ends the article with:

> From the point of view of history as well as from that of
> contemporary conditions the library needs to be studied in the
> light of sociology, economics, and other branches of human
> knowledge (p. 282).

**Reflection:** I really enjoyed this article. It provides
questions that still need answers today.

**Reflection:** Competition is still key, I think, for
understanding libraries today:

- public libraries vs. other leisurely activities
- academic libraries vs. information seeking behaviours +
  information use (my dissertation)
