**Note:** The sixth article of the first issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled
"Sound and Unsound Economy in Cataloging."

It was written by J. C. M. Hanson, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** This is a nice piece on the importance of doing good
cataloging work and on the lack of understanding that some
administrators had (at the time) about the complexity of doing
good cataloging work (and the associated costs). Good article to
cite in case I do more work related to the historical view of
librarians by administrations. 

**Note:** Quotes Charles Martel, then "chief of the Catalog
Division of the Library of Congress" (p. 67). See footnotes for
information about the Martel papers to read. The author indicates
that this material should be,

> read and re-read by those who ever and anon feel called on to
> attack the catalogues which aim to give somewhat full and
> explicit information (p. 67).

**Note:** And this is essentially the modern agenda:

> The arguments so far presented may be summed up as follows: (1)
> curtailment and omission of information and a lowering of
> standards of academic and professional training required from
> the cataloguing staff are not sound economy; (2) not only must
> the staff be permitted to make the bibliographical
> investigations necessary to insure an accurate and satisfactory
> entry, but it must be encouraged in these efforts; (3) competent
> supervision and revision must be provided to insure a proper
> correlation of results, harmony, and unity of interpretations
> and decisions; (4) the road to sound economy lies through the
> cooperation of many libraries---the more the better---agreement
> on rules and methods, and the establishment of a central
> authority to insure unity of effort (p. 71).

**Note:** Great article. Interesting story about a conversation
the author had with Charles A. Cutter. See page 73.
