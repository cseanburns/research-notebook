**Note:** The fourth article of the second issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "What Subjects Appeal to the General
Reader?." It was written by Douglas Waples, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** Waples begins with a nice starting question, one that he
acknowledges would be nice to answer yet difficult to do so:

> why is it that some people read and others do not (P. 189).

**Note:** It will be important to highlight how the topics in many
of these early *LQ* articles are still the topics we are working
on today. I'll need to classify these in my paper on this.

**Note:** This is really a fantastic article on reading, or, on
"what people would like to read about" (p. 191).

**Note:** I think one key insight about this paper, regardless (or
because) of the findings it reports, is that understanding reading
will require understanding both books and people. Neither can be
investigated separately if any hope of understanding what it means
to read is desired.

**Note:** Damaging:

> Another example will serve to show how the procedure may be used
> to find the subjects of most interest to a given community. A
> public librarian, of long experience in small and medium-sized
> communities, selected 23 of the 117 topics appearing on the
> check-list when asked to select topics on which most books
> needed to be purchased to meet the public library demand.
> Sixteen groups were then chosen as best representing a typical
> American community. The 23 topics considered by the librarian to
> be most in demand were then compared with the topics in which
> most interest was expressed by the sixteen groups. Only 3 topics
> appeared in both lists! Twenty of the 23 library topics were
> relatively uninteresting to half of the sixteen groups and 12
> other topics, not selected by the librarian, were found to be
> just as interesting as the 3 most interesting topics he had
> selected (p. 198).

**Note:** Historically, an interesting tidbit:

> About thirty public libraries and many college libraries make
> some provision for helping readers to find books of most
> interest and value. In public libraries such help is given by an
> assistant called "reader's adviser" (pp. 200-201).
