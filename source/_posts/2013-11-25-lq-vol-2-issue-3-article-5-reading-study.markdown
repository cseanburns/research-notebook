**Note:** The fifth article of the third issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Four Great Libraries
of Medieval Baghdad."

It was written by Ruth Stellhorn Mackensen, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Hartford, Connecticut (No affiliation)

**Note:** Begins with a brief overview of libraries in Baghdad and
their collections and then "describes four of the great libraries
of Baghdad and the institutions which housed them" (p. 280).

Nice paragraph:

> Probably the most interesting aspect of these libraries is the
> important place they held in the cultural life of the time. They
> were no musty storehouses where books lay seldom used and at the
> mercy of ignorant attendants. Instead, one sees them as centers
> in which assembled literary men and learned doctors. Books were
> gathered by men who loved them, and were in constant use by
> scholars and eager students. These libraries were busy places.
> The librarians, frequently men noted for their attainments in
> many fields, went out or sent others to gather rare and precious
> books which, if necessary, were copied and translated into
> Arabic. The position of librarian in Muslim lands during the
> medieval ages must have been an honorable one, for in these four
> libraries, as in others, it was often filled by great scholars,
> chosen apparently for their knowledge of books. They were
> figures important in the society of their times and often at
> court, members, rather than mere servants, of the cultured and
> learned groups which gathered in the libraries (p. 281).

**Note:** The article is interesting, beautifully written, and I'm
learning a lot because much of the topic lies outside my scope of
knowledge.

**Note:** I like this passage:

> Abd al Salām recalled an occasion when he was present at a class
> conducted by a noted grammarian, Abu Saīd al Sirāfi. A student
> was reading aloud from a philological work, and the master
> interrupted him to dissertate on a fine point of grammar
> illustrated by a quoted poem. Abd al Salām differed openly with
> the professor's explanation, thereby humiliating Al Sirāfi's son
> who was present. He arose at once, returned to his shop (he was
> a butter merchant), sold his business, and took to study. He
> devoted himself exclusively to learning until he became a
> scholar of the highest rank, and then composed a treatise in
> which he explained the troublesome verses which had brought
> embarrassment to his august father (pp. 291-292).

**Note:** Another nice remark (leaving out the anecdote, which is
delightful):

> The somewhat trivial anecdote shows the concern of a librarian
> for the books in his care, and also that librarians were not
> above playing the sort of pranks one might rather expect from
> run boys (p. 293).

**Reflection:** A few weeks ago I was telling someone about this
reading project of mine and I said that if I were able to teach a
library history doctoral seminar, I could see myself assigning at
least the first couple of volumes of *LQ* for reading. I think
that leads to an important argument for my thesis about the
importance of the journal as a whole unit as opposed to an
isolated reading of selected articles. I'll need to pursue this in
my paper.

**Note:** The author takes a jab:

> Perhaps it is an early example of the type of school which seeks
> to attract students by imposing buildings and modern equipment
> rather than by high standards of scholarship (p. 298).
