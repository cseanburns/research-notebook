This entry is about:

(1932). The Public Library in the Depression. *The Library
Quarterly, 2*(4), 321-343.

**Note:** The first article of the fourth issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Public Library in
the Depression."

It was *prepared* by Douglas Waples, Leon Carnovsky, and William
M. Randall, who were affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** I use the word *prepared* above because this article has
no official author. Instead, the first footnote states the
following, as a footnote to the title of the article:

> This article was prepared by Douglas Waples, Leon Carnovsky, and
> William M. Randall from data collected by the *Library
> quarterly* (p. 321).

I feel, then, as if I'm violating something (perhaps a rule) by
explicitly placing Waples, Carnovsky, and Randall's names in the
reference above. It's as if the *Library Quarterly* itself is the
author of this piece (supposed corporate authorship?). However,
according to the [index](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4301917) for
the volume, these three men are listed as the authors. Randall, it
should be noted, is the journal's managing editor.

**Note:** Aside from the authorship issue, given the topic of this
article and the recent recession, this should make for a really
interesting piece.

To get started:

> First, decreased revenues from taxation have resulted in smaller
> appropriations for library purposes (p. 321).

Huh, sounds current.

> The second respect in which the library has felt the effects of
> the depression is in the increased service the library is called
> upon to render (p. 322).

That also sounds current.

And then this:

> We read that people out of work are spending more time either in
> reading for recreation - to "kill time" - or in reading
> seriously, to learn the fundamental economics involved in the
> depression or to acquire new educational equipment in the hope
> of improving their chances for a new job (p. 322).

And this, the reaction, sounds current:

> Small wonder, then, that the leaders in the profession have
> raised the cry against drastic reductions in library
> acquisitions, for seldom before has the library stood out so
> sharply as a source of individual hope and social amelioration
> (p. 322).

**Note:** This is a good question / assumption to highlight:

> Theoretically, if library service is to remain constant, the
> library appropriation should be actually increased (p. 325).

**Note:** Lots of relevant (to today) questions being explored in
this piece -- about collections, service, salaries, buildings, and
so on. I'll leave that out of these notes, but this is a nice
piece of wisdom, I think:

> The foregoing data should interest the librarian in so far as he
> can place his own institution in the general picture. But such
> orientation demands a knowledge of local conditions affecting
> other libraries like his own. Without such knowledge it does him
> little good to know whether or not the other libraries are
> effecting the same economies. The fact that other libraries of
> the same size and type are reducing the same items of expense in
> the same proportion does not in itself show whether his own
> budgeting is wise or unwise (p. 337).

The questions raised in the paragraph following the above passage
are brilliant.

**Note:** My goodness, this sounds like the ROI literature of
today:

> Library officials will be forced, as never before in this
> country, to rest their claims for appropriations, not upon
> sentimental appeals, but upon the sort of evidence that city
> officials obtain from other departments. Library development may
> easily receive a permanent setback if, when called to account,
> the profession cannot demonstrate, specifically and
> convincingly, the nature and scope of its service (p. 338).

**Note:** This article continues to be brilliant.

**Note:** On not being trivial (this is also brilliant):

> Most librarians testify to large increases in economics,
> sociology, political science, and history. But what are we to
> conclude? That the muddle which politics has made of economics
> is driving men to John Stuart Mill and his peers for
> consolation, that the reading is mostly current history of the
> [Charles A.
> Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard) type, or
> that the readers are at last taking the crisis seriously enough
> to read forthright explanations of it in [Stuart
> Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Chase),
> [Laidler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_W._Laidler), and
> the unfettered spokesman of the left (p. 341)?

**Note:** This is fascinating (it immediately follows the above
paragraph:

> The writer has checked a list of the better-known left-wing
> writers against the catalogues of two city libraries and found
> them very poorly represented. The problem of censorship involved
> here is incidentally a matter of critical importance to public
> confidence in the library (p. 341).

**Reflection:** This is simply one of the best articles I've read.
Waples, Carnovsky, and Randall deserve their status as
intellectual giants in library science.
