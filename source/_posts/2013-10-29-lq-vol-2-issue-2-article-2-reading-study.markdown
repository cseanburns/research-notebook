**Note:** The second article of the second issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "What Library Schools
Are Not."

It was written by Ernest J. Reece, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Columbia University

**Note:** With some history of the library school. It's early
purpose, Reece argues:

> Some device was needed to turn more people into library work,
> and that quickly. The one adopted, namely, the library school,
> became by pre-emption and default the agency not alone for
> training but in large degree that for recruiting, selecting,
> measuring, apprenticing, and placing (p. 107).

Then:

> Diversity of function, therefore, is a thing by which the
> library schools of today have come honestly, and which,
> incidentally, there is no likelihood that they ever can abandon
> wholly (p. 107).

And the purpose of this paper:

> It is fitting to consider, however, to what extent present
> conditions warrant its persistence. In doing so, the several
> offices referred to above will be touched in sequence (p. 107).

By offices, Reece means the actions listed above: recruiting,
selecting, measuring, apprenticing, and placing.

**Note:** This is an important line of argument that gives
credence to the argument that library schools should not be
vocational schools:

> It is to be remembered, however, that school conditions differ
> signally \[significantly?\] from field situations in general and
> violently from specific field situations, that the circumstances
> and incentives in a school year for a given student are often
> abnormal, and that predictions based on school performance
> therefore are not to be made with certainty (p. 109).

**Note:** In short, Reece's final note:

> The positive principle inescapable in any thoroughgoing
> consideration of school activities is that the first and last
> duty of a school is to instruct. This is true for library
> schools as well as for schools of other types; and in the case
> of library schools, the time has come to assert it, and perhaps
> to shout it, rather than merely to allow it (p. 111).

**Reflection:** It's helpful (and suggestive by the author) to
read this article by keeping in mind the difference between and
the evolution of the library school of the 1880s and 1890s with
the library school of the 1930s.
