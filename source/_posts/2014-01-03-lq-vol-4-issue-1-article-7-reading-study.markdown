**Note:** The seventh article of the first issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "A Study of the
Relationship between Reading Interest and Actual Reading."

It was written by Leon Carnovsky, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago

**Note:** This is the fourth article by Carnovsky. He has an
article in each volume so far.

**Note:** As with Carnovsky's first article in *LQ*, this is an
article about adult education and adult reading. He writes:

> When the Graduate Library School was established at the
> University of Chicago, the field of adult reading was recognized
> as one directly pertinent to the primary objectives of
> librarianship and as a field of great social importance in
> itself. It was felt that cultivation of the field might serve to
> clarify certain fundamental objectives of public libraries,
> college libraries, and other agencies for the distribution of
> substantial literature (p. 78).

Then he provides an outline, with research questions, of what this
field of adult reading seeks to ask. Quoted in part (questions
omitted):

> A. Reading matter available  
> B. Reading population  
> C. The demand for reading  
> D. The status of reading  
> E. Consumption of reading  
> F. Effects of reading (p. 78).

**Note:** Nice quote:

> For the union between book and reader is a much more complex
> phenomenon than might appear at first glance (p. 79).

**Note:** Much mention of Waples' work on reading. See previous
articles by Waple in *LQ*:

**Note:** Inasmuch as this article is about preferences (reading),
Carnovsky does a wonderful job revealing how complicated
preferences are and how complicated it is to measure them.
Consider the following passage. Carnovsky makes a go at measuring
preferences, but he hedges his bets:

> But if it were possible to measure, however roughly, the extent
> to which the objective factors have been present and thus have
> influenced reading, it would be possible to understand their
> influences as affecting reading interests. In the following
> discussion an approach is made to the problem of indicating and
> measuring certain factors whose presence or absence probably
> bears a definite relationship to the reading done (p. 83).

**Note:** This is a long, detailed article and what Carnovsky is
trying to do is to, begin at least, establish some causal factors
that lead to reading particular works. Or at least have a
discussion about the possibility of that. He knows it's big game
hunting and that he's not going to accomplish it with this study
(which is nicely described), but the goal seems to be his main
agenda.
