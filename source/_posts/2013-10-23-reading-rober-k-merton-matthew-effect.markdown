Some notes on reading "The Matthew Effect in Science" in [The
Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical
Investigations](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817893417) by Robert
K. Merton.

**Note:** Recognition:

> Some time ago it was noted that graded awards in the realm of
> science are distributed principally in the coin of recognition
> accorded by fellow scientists (p. 439).

Two key points:

- the award is recognition
- the award is *given by* "fellow scientists"

The obvious question is whether recognition that is awarded by
those outside the institution of science is worth more or less.

**Note:** "The 41st chair" (pp. 440-441). Those who have made
highly significant scientific contributions but who will never
receive the highest honors.

> History serves as an appellate court, ready to reverse the
> judgments of the lower courts, which are limited by the myopia
> of contemporaneity. But in greater part, the phenomenon of the
> forty-first chair is an artifact of having a fixed number of
> places available at the summit of recognition. Moreover, when a
> particular generation is rich in achievements of a high order,
> it follows from the rule of fixed numbers that some whose
> accomplishments rank as high as those actually given the award
> will be excluded from the honorific rank (p. 441).

All the participants in this system are aware of the 41st chair.

**Note:** The never ending pursuit, the *way station*:

> What appears from below to be the summit becomes, in the
> experience of those who have reached it, only another way
> station. The scientist's peers and other associates regard each
> of his scientific achievements as only the prelude to new and
> greater achievements. Such social pressures do not often permit

> achievement to remain constant (p. 442).

Are those scientists who are highlighted by social media, and by
non-scientists, feel the same pressure? Do they feel that greater
expectations are placed on this, because of this medium?

**Note:** Class structure and the reward system:

> Without deliberate intent on the part of any group, the reward
> system thus influences the "class structure" of science by
> providing a stratified distribution of chances, among
> scientists, for enlarging their role as investigators (p. 443).

And:

> There is thus a continuing interplay between the status system,
> based on honor and esteem, and the class system, based on
> differential life-chances, which locates scientists in differing
> positions within the opportunity structure of science (p. 443).

Does social media influence a class structure too?

**Note:** The retroactive judgment implies that earlier work can
function as an investment for a future payoff. Even though the
payoff at the time may be null or a cost.

See (short quoting now, see text for full marked passages):

> Should the younger scientists ... (p. 444).

And:

> but only temporarily *if* he continues ... (p. 444).

And:

> In the end, then, a sort of rough-hewn justice ... (p. 445)

**Note:** In sum:

> the Matthew effect consists of the accruing of greater
> increments of recognition ... (p. 446).

**Note:** The "Eccliesiasticus components" (p. 447).

> But it has other implications for the development of science,
> and we must shift our angle of theoretical vision in order to
> identify them (p. 447).

**Note:** Science and scholarly communication:

> the standpoint of science conceived of as a system of
> communication (p. 447).

**Note:** *am* it seems to me, doesn't really change the system.
It only seems to augment and strengthen it. In this sense, it does
not seem so revolutionary.

**Note:** Proceeds to discuss science as the communication of science.

**Note:** There's no science w/o the communication of science. The
reporting of science is the scientific enterprise.

> from the standpoint of science conceived of as a system of
> communication (p. 447).

**Note:** More of a side note about scholars' reading habits:

> It has been found, for example, that only about half of 1
> percent of the articles published in journals of chemistry are
> read by any other one chemist (p. 448).

And, for those that read:

> The American Psychological Association study found that from 15
> to 23 percent of the psychologist-readers' behaviors in
> selecting articles were based on the identity of the authors (p.
> 449).

See footnote 24 on p. 449 for reference to the Coles' study.
Here's the reference, from footnote 23:

> 23\. S. Cole and J. R. Cole, "Visibility and the Structural
> Bases of Observability in Science," a paper presented before the
> American Sociological Association, August 1967, and developed
> further in their *Social Stratification in Science* (p. 448).

**Note:** This is the *genius* of some researchers / scientists
who use social media effectively. Whether their research is
original, scientific, rigorous, or etc. hardly matters. Rather,
it's their ability and determination to aggressively communicate
their messages that has been the cornerstone of their achievement.

The question is whether the content of their message has been
"socially validated." The use of social media by researchers whose
research has not been socially validated can highlight an ability
that ends up abusing and causing harm to the institution of
science. It is the communication of valid science that needs to be
aggressive.

All this highlights those odd cases where a junior researcher's
esteem becomes greater than the senior researcher's, even before
the research has been socially validated.

> But, for science to be advanced, it is not enough that fruitful

Then, in the next paragraph:

> Looking at the Matthew effect from this perspective, we have
> noted the distinct possibility that contributions made by
> scientists of considerable standing are the most likely to enter
> promptly and widely into the communication networks of science,
> and so to accelerate its development (p. 450).

Junior researchers, by effective use of social media, are then
capable of **bootstrapping** their standing w/o at first really
contributing knowledge. At least, that's the possibility.

**Note:** The focalizing effect:

> shown elsewhere (see footnote 29), had in large part also been

More: 

> It is no so much that these great men of science pass on their
> techniques, methods, information, and theory to novices working
> with them. More consequently, they convey to their associates
> the norms and values that govern significant research. Often in

> institutionalized, in the forms of schools of thought and
> research establishments (pp. 452-453)

And:

> the importance of problem-*finding*, not only problem-solving.

Sometimes these norms and values are based not on significant
research but on the **bootstrapping** ability to get one's self
into the proper arena in a very substantial way.

But, the above in more detail, as it pertains to the *aesthetics*
of the scientific institution:

> The role of outstanding scientists in influencing younger
> associates is repeatedly emphasized in the interviews with
> laureates. Almost invariably they lay great emphasis on the
> importance of problem-*finding*, not only problem-solving. They
> uniformly express the strong conviction that what matters most
> in their work is a developing sense of taste, of judgment, in
> seizing upon problems that are of fundamental importance (p.
> 453).

And this is the *aesthetics of science*. See the line, middle of
paragraph, about the "expansion of taste" as well as "attitude."

But the aesthetic of problem-finding is intertwined with the
basic, hard-work of doing science. Social media's affordances lets
someone **bootstrap** past the hard-work, at least hypothetically.
It deflates the aesthetic. The recent no-named movement represents
a post-modern aesthetic base on a topsy-turvy lack of hard
scientific work and lots of rhetoric. This is post-science, if not
just post-modern. 

And:

> Certain aspects of their character also play a part. With few
> exceptions, these are men of exceptional ego strength (p. 453).

And:

> Their self-assurance finds varied expression within the context
> of science as a social institution. That institution, as we
> know, includes a norm calling for autonomous and critical
> judgment about one's own work of others (p. 453).

And: 

> They exhibit a great capacity to tolerate frustration in their
> work, absorbing repeated failures without manifest psychological
> damage (p. 453).

**Note:** Then the entire middle paragraph on page 455. Specially
this part:

> Outstanding scientists tend to develop an immunity to *insanabile
> scribendi cacoēthes* (the itch to publish) (p. 455).

And the next sentence, which I separate just to emphasize the
notion of *merely extensive*:

> Since they prefer their published work to be significant and
> fruitful rather than *merely extensive*, their contributions are
> apt to matter \[emphasis added\] (p. 455).

**Note:** Whether this is still true; that is, whether effective
social media campaigns can *bootstrap* the Matthew effect:

> After all, scientists do not begin by being eminent..." (p.
> 456).

**Note:** On the bias towards eminence and violating the norm of
universalism:

> When the Matthew effect is thus transformed into an idol of
> authority, it violates the norm of universalism embodied in the
> institution of science and curbs the advancement of knowledge
> (p. 457).

**Note:** It's not just that the richer get richer, Merton points
out, it's also that the poor get poorer. There is a finite amount
of scholarly wealth or currency, so to speak.

> This is expressed in the principle of cumulative advantage that
> operates in many systems of social stratification to produce the
> same result: the rich get richer at a rate that makes the poor
> become relatively poorer (p. 457).

Thus, real world problems for certain institutions to climb to the
top (unless they can *bootstrap* themselves, perhaps):

> These social processes of social selection that deepen the
> concentration of top scientific talent create extreme
> difficulties for any efforts to counteract the institutional
> consequences of the Matthew principle in order to produce new
> centers of scientific excellence (p. 458).
