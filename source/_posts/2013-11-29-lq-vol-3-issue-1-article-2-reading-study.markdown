**Note:** The second article of the first issue of the third
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Some Implications in
the New Plan of the University of Chicago for College
Libraries."

It was written by Augustus Frederick Kuhlman, who was
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Chicago Libraries

**Note:** The article discusses the impact or implications
resulting from changes that the University of Chicago
President Robert Maynard had overseen (the *New Plan*). I've
read about this before, but I can't recall which work it was.
Will have to investigate later.

**Note:** The author then discusses how the library will
support the New Plan. He discusses the new courses and the
specific ways the library will support these courses. Very
detailed.

**Note:** Nice observation:

> Third, in this new curriculum and as part of the teaching
> method and content, books hold a position of major
> importance. But not just books, not even titles in a
> standard list, are called for. As was just pointed out,
> quality of titles, and specific titles for a specific
> purpose, is what counts. Once a college abolishes course
> credits and grades as a basis for granting a degree and
> tries to set up genuine and tested educational attainments as
> the prerequisite, the great problem becomes: How can the
> best that the human spirit has achieved be made available to the
> student? (p. 33).

**Note:** I'll have to search for where I read about Robert
Maynard Hutchins and his work at the University of Chicago.
It's at the tip of my tongue, but it'll have to wait till next
week.
