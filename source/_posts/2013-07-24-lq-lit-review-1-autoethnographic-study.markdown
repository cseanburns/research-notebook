**Note:** I'm taking a momentary break from my reading of *LQ* to
review an article on the same subject matter. Specifically, this
entry is about Steve Norman's historical article on the early
years of *The Library Quarterly*. Reference above.

## Brief Literature Review

Wiegand's comment on this article:

> Steve Norman analyzes the conflicts leading to the establishment
> of the *Library Quarterly* at the University of Chicago's
> Graduate Library School in 1931 and demonstrates the library
> community's resistance to GLS's emphasis on research and
> scholarship. His work is an outstanding piece of scholarship
> based on careful research into primary (and unpublished) sources
> and shows the confusion early *LQ* editors about determining
> publication criteria and the journal's early direction and
> agenda (p. 563).

history. *Libraries &amp; Culture, 25*(4), 543-574.

**Note:** Wiegand is right. From the start, this is a fascinating
piece. Norman begins by describing the state of affairs at the
time before the *LQ* began publication. Key highlights:

- Three Carnegie Corporation commissioned studies highlighted "a
  growing dissatisfaction with training for librarianship" (p.
  328). One commission conducted by C. C. Williamson.
- In response, "ALA formed in 1923 the Temporary Library Training
  Board to set up a system for accrediting library schools" (p.
  328). This was made permanent in 1925.
- A college degree, before this time, "was required for admission
  to only two library schools. In fact, nearly half the
  instructors in library schools were not college graduates" (p.
  328).
- Then this quote:

> The Graduate Library School at the University of Chicago (GLS)
> was to encounter bitter hostility to this view that library
> education should conform to a research university's model of
> graduate education. William M. Randall, who was to become *LQ*'s
> first editor, wrote later that "the attitude of (almost) the
> entire profession [was that they] could see no possible need for
> the type of research organization that Chicago was trying to
> establish" [1, p. 73]. *LQ* began publication in this context.

The quoted source is:

Richardson, John, Jr. *The Spirit of Inquiry: The Graduate Library
School at Chicago, 1921-51*. Chicago: American Library
Association. 1982.

**Note:** At one of the early GLS faculty meetings, shortly after
the idea of a "journal of discussion" was proposed, the faculty
decided to let "ALA to have an advisory board connected with a GLS
journal. If, however, the school financed the journal, the school
would have editorial control" (p. 330). It's interesting to think
of this as the beginnings of an early schism. Although that may be
way too powerful a term to describe this development.

**Note:** Much of the early discussion about establishing a
journal centered on the journal functioning as an "organ" of GLS.
It would, that is, primarily be a medium of publication for the
output of research of GLS faculty and students. Although *LQ* did
not become an organ for GLS only publications, this early intent
does represent the small research culture that existed in
librarianship at the time.

**Note:** GLS faculty were very concerned about who would have
control of the journal. They wanted it to be under their control
and not ALA's.

**Note:** Richard Bowker, then editor of the *Library Journal*:

> mentioned his hope that the new journal would not compete with
> other publications [....] That Bowker had objected to possible
> competition is likely considering his review of *LQ*'s first
> issue (p. 335).

Norman quotes a bit from that review, which was poor and reflects
my own thoughts, expressed in previous posts, on the lack of
research articles in the first issue of *LQ*.

**Note:** Norman's comment on [C. C. Williamson's][1] article in
the first issue of *LQ* reflects what I had thought about the
intent of the journal (I seem to be on the right track). Norman
writes:

> The decision by the GLS faculty to run Williamson's article as
> the first in *LQ* implies that the journal was conceived, at
> least to some degree, as a means of infusing scientific method
> into studies of library issues (p. 336).

My first thoughts about this issue were that, it just takes time
to establish something like this---especially something like a
serious research journal---in a field that did not previously have
a research culture. Norman writes that the second issue was more
positively received, since it had more research articles, and
that:

> In any event, the six months between *LQ*'s establishment and
> its first issue had not allowed much time for measuring up to
> five years' worth of expectations (p. 337).

**Note:** Just before the conclusion section of the article,
Norman provides a descriptive breakdown or "distribution of types
of articles" (p. 348) published in the first five years of *LQ*.
This is helpful. Here's the breakdown:

- descriptive articles: 23%
- library science research descriptive studies: 21%
- opinion articles: 19%
- historical articles: 13%
- library science research experimental studies: 3%
- sociological studies: 2%
- textual criticism: 2% (p. 348)

> Other nonresearch articles constituted the remainder (p. 348).

**Reflection:** Norman's history of the first years of *LQ* is
more comprehensive in scope than my autoethnographic reading of
the first four issues of *LQ*. First, mine is not a history, and
as such, benefits from Norman's article greatly. Second, my focus
is only on the main articles published in these first four
volumes, and does not cover other types of articles, such as book
reviews, and which Norman does discuss. By way of that, the
Sears/Thompson book review controversy described by Norman from
page 339 and on is quite fascinating, in that it represents an
early divide between the research community and the practitioner
community, by way of a misunderstanding of their respective
purposes and needs (and some hubris on the part of certain
portions of the research community, perhaps).

**Reflection:** Aside from the interesting narrative Norman
provides in this article, the main implication, for me, is the
simple existence of such a narrative and what this means for those
who, perhaps too rashly, argue for moving beyond the journal
simply because web and Internet related technologies allow or
afford moving beyond the journal. That said, there may be merit in
moving beyond the journal. That will be for others to decide, and
for various disciplines or fields of research to determine for
themselves. However, although such a move may mean a loss or a
gain for those research cultures, the role that journals have
played in developing a field or a professional identity should be
part of the discussion. In other words, history should be part of
the discussion.

**Note:** This is an information seeking note. My [abstract][2]
has an obvious omission: no literature review of any articles on
the *LQ*. At the time I wrote that abstract, I was more interested
in reviewing the literature on autoethnography. Also, the
motivation, as described in that abstract, led me toward a
different set of literature to review---literature on current
scholarly communication problems and issues. I *stumbled upon*
Norman's history of the early years of *LQ* because I pulled up
the Wikipedia [article][3] on the journal for a reason I can no
longer remember. According to Wikipedia's [revision history][4] of
its article on *LQ*, the reference to Norman's article was added
on February 10, 2011 by User *Wskent*.

After I found Norman's article, I did a keyword search for it,
using the names of the author and title, on [Google Scholar][5] in
order to quickly see if any one had cited Norman's article. That's
how I found Wiegand's article (reference above), which briefly
describes Norman's piece. (I quote that description above.)
