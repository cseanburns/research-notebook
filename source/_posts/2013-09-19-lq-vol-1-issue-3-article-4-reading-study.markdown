This entry is about:

Howe, Harriet E. (1931). The Library School Curriculum. *The
Library Quarterly, 1*(3), 283-290.

**Note:** The fourth article of the third issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "The Library School Curriculum."

It was written by Harriet E. Howe, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** Wow, this is a great opening line:

> In discussing education for librarianship, the assumption is
> made that librarianship is a profession (p. 283).

And the following passage explains why library school is not (and
should not be) a technical school:

> There are data now available that serve to distinguish clerical
> duties from professional duties in the cataloging department. By
> means of such data it becomes possible to omit from the
> library-school course all purely clerical operations as such.
> However, it is still desirable to retain such emphasis on
> clerical duties as will enable the professional cataloguer to
> supervise the clerical work intelligently (p. 283).

The question is, then, how much of a separation of clerical duties
from professional duties has there been since this was published
in 1931, over 80 years ago? Out of interest of defining the
profession as a profession, this would be nice to map.

**Note:** On the need to be adaptable:

> A second principle governing the curriculum requires that the
> best current practice be taught with sufficient allowance for
> future improvements and expansions (p. 283).

**Note:** This is great:

> Librarianship is rapidly shifting its attention from the
> mechanics of administration to the needs of the reader (p. 284).

And I think this explains quite a bit about library reference
courses, as they are taught today:

> In all the library schools there are courses called "reference,"
> or "reference and bibliography." Usually these courses are
> devoted to the study of reference books--not, as one teacher
> wishes that they might be, to reference work. "We use no
> reference book as a final source for information for the reader.
> We use any source, whether it is a circulation or a reference
> book, a library catalogue, correspondence, or the picture file.
> Another teacher has advocated the teaching of the courses now
> called "book selection" and "reference" as one course,
> discussing books by subject from the standpoint of their
> potential readers" (pp. 284-285).

**Reflection:** The next couple paragraphs address questions and
issues related to courses teaching in a way that will allow
students to generalize to their specific interests. This is an
important development in the thinking about librarianship, and
based on my readings so far, it is easy to see the effect that
this type of position, many of which seem to be held by faculty at
the Graduate Library School at the time, had on the development of
library science and library science education. 

**Reflection:** The use of the term *book* in this article strikes
me in a certain way. There does not seem to be an attachment to
the object other than for its ability to disseminate information,
which is a term the author explicitly uses (see previous quote).
If this same author were writing today, I think she could be
writing about other formats and media as easily as she writes
about the book.  It's here, I think, that I see some of the first
moves toward the abstraction of content away from the object that
holds or contains that content. If I'm reading this correctly,
this article is an extremely forward-thinking piece.

**Note:** Already, the focus on the user:

> Can cataloging, for example, be taught from the standpoint of
> the user of the catalogue, not from the standpoint of the maker
> of the catalogue (p. 286)?

The rest of the paragraph is genius. Consider the following, in
which the stress on the defense of the decision-making of
cataloguers highlights the importance of such decisions--this is
essentially about the application of a rational framework, a
*science*, to the work:

> As a further illustration, could the prospective administrator
> study cataloguing with the problem of administration in mind,
> asking the cataloguers to defend the cataloguing decisions that
> they are making ... (p. 286)?

**Note:** Just an historical note about the trends in "library
architecture" (a term the author uses to describe a type of social
architecture regarding the division of the library) and about the
topic of subject specialists:

> If, as present trends indicate, the future library is to be
> subdivided by subject rather than by department, is it not the
> task of the library school to prepare librarians who can become
> specialists in the subjects (p. 287)?

**Note:** How does this change the meaning, when substituting
*information* for *book*:

Original:

> The readers want book aid from those who know books (p. 287).

Revised:

> The readers want *information* aid from those who know
> *information* (p. 287).

**Reflection:** It is important for this author that librarians
have subject knowledge related to an area where they assist
readers. Secondary graduate degrees are not mentioned (so far) but
undergraduate education is, and thus the quality of undergraduate
education will have a substantial impact on the quality of
librarianship. Our field, therefore, should be very concerned with
the quality of higher education in general, above and beyond the
normal amount of attention that might be directed toward it.

The author seems to make this point in the next paragraph:

> The library school attached to a university or college [not all
> were at the time] has an opportunity to direct students in the
> same institution before they enter the professional school and
> can accomplish something by correspondence with those
> prospective students in other institutions (pp. 287-288).

**Reflection:** My one problem with this attention to subject
specialization rests on my argument that the methods used by
librarians (or information professionals in general) should be
generalized enough that subject knowledge is necessary in mostly a
trivial way. Such generalized skills of the librarian should help
that librarian switch to different subject matters if necessary.
That kind of flexibility seems to me to be a necessary condition
of being a professional--for librarians at least, whose subject
matter is largely the methods they need. For example, the signals
that highlight the quality of an article or book in philosophy
should be comparable to the signals that highlight the quality of
an article or book in biology. Understanding those signals, and
how to use and manipulate them to retrieve good information, seems
to me to be the important matter.

**Note:** Interesting this list on the requirements of the
librarian:

> Common sense, tact, courtesy, poise, administrative ability,
> speed, accuracy, reliability, initiative, are all essential; but
> the greatest of all is good judgment in relating books to
> readers (p. 289).
