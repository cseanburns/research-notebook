**Note:** The twenty-ninth article of the second issue of the
fourth volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Technische
Literatur in Deutschen Bibliotheken."

It was written by Paul Trommsdorff, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Bibliothek der Technischen

**Note:** I'm not sure what the thesis of this article is, but
it's clearly in some sense about the growth of German scientific
and technical literature.
