## Lit Review Notes

Bornmann, Lutz. (2008). Scientific Peer Review: An Analysis of the
Peer Review Process from the Perspective of Sociology of Science
Theories. *Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of
Self-Knowledge, 6*(2), 23-38.

> it is the task of the 'reviewers' in the review process, as
> 'gate keepers' of science ... (p. 24).

**Note:** My question: does the function involved with **gate
keeping** necessitate any particular form or method of peer
review?

**Note:** The lack of "theory guided empirical studies":

> As Glaser and Laudel (2006:187) state, "There is a stark
> discrepancy between the number of empirical peer review studies
> and the theoretical understanding of the process. The few theory
> guided empirical studies that are available are found
> predominantly in the older research on peer review, which was
> strongly shaped by Robert K. Merton (1973) and what is called
> the North American school .... (p. 24).

Note in the above quote there is no ending quotation mark to the
Glaser and Laudel quote. References cited in the above quote are,
in the format used in the paper:

Glaser, J. and G. Laudel. 2006. "Advantages and dangers of
'remote' peer evaluation. *Research Evaluation* 14:186 198.

Merton, R. K. 1973. "The sociology of science: theoretical and
empirical investigations. Chicago, IL., USA: University of Chicago
Press.

**Note:** This is an important bit, and seems to be too true
today:

> In peer review research, the fact of the North American school
> losing its dominant position in sociology of science and being
> superseded by social constructivism in the late 1970s and early
> 1980s was connected with a transition from a more theory guided
> to a more atheoretical, empirical analysis of the peer review
> process (p. 24).

Then quoting the Glaser and Laudel work:

> "the literature shifts to atheoretical, empiricist approaches by
> scientists and editors who were mainly interested in the
> validity and reliability of peer review process (Glaser and
> Laudel 2006:187)" (p. 24).

**Note:** Some of the problems related to theory guided peer
review stem from the inability to observe what happens at a
"spatial distance" (p. 25).

**Note:** The objective of Bornmann's paper is to offer an updated
theoretical framework for analyzing peer review.

**Note:** Bornmann analyzes peer review from three perspectives:

- North American School
- social constructivism
- social systems theory (Luhmann 1992)

See (if translation is available):

Luhmann, N. 1992. Die Wissenschaft der Gesell schaft. Frankfurt am
Main, Germany: Suhrkamp.

**Note:** The second part of the paper, reviews "Empirical
Studies in Peer Review."

**Note:** Next section discusses the reliability of peer
review---e.g., inter rater reliability among peer reviewers of a
manuscript. Disagreement about the importance of
reliability---with some arguing that strong inter rater
reliability signifies good peer review, while others argue that it
represents a loss of validity, as the peer reviewers are not
representing "diverse perspectives" and so on. See page 26.

**Note:** Next section discusses the "fairness of peer review,"
e.g., bias. Mixed results in studies on gender bias. No
experimental studies to date. Therefore, no real knowledge of bias
existing, or what kind.

**Note:** Next section discusses the "predictive validity of peer
review." Since there is no universal or "uniform" definition of
"best" work, or work that is "'worthy of publication'" or
"'funding'", then citation counts (metrics) are generally used to
evaluate worth.

**Note:** The third part of the paper, on "Peer Review from the
Point of View of Sociology of Science Theories."

**Note:** The first section discusses peer review within Merton's
framework: the norms, which are (or should be) well known,
include:

> (1) scientific knowledge should be made public knowledge
> (communism, or communality), (2) the scientist forgoes all forms
> of personal gain (disinterestedness), (3) knowledge must always
> be scrutinized (organized skepticism), and (4) knowledge claims
> should be judged impersonally, independently of their source
> (universalism) (p. 27).

**Note:** The second section discusses the Social constructivist
view, which rejects Merton's (or the North American school's)
norms, "and replace them with their own assumptions" (p. 28).
These assumptions include:

One:

> *First assumption: Scientific behavior is not governed by the
> norms that Merton identified and set out as the ethos of
> science* (p. 29).

Two:

> *Second assumption: Scientists do not own the privilege of
> participation in the scientific discourse in their field of
> science* (p. 29).

Three:

> *Third assumption: Scientific knowledge does not reflect
> 'natural reality' but is instead constructed socially and
> locally* (p. 30).

Four:

> *Fourth assumption: Scientific work is a social construction of
> the scientist under review **and** the reviewers* (p. 31).

**Note:** Here's an important, pertinent piece related to my
research project:

> The followers of social constructivism contradict this
> assumption. To them, it is not only the author that is
> responsible for the content of a manuscript (and has rights to
> the intellectual property); the content of a manuscript is a
> joint product by the author, reviewer, and editor (p. 31).

Specifically, encouraging the reviewers of a manuscript to reveal
their identities gives those reviewers, when they do reveal their
identities, some responsibility, if not also ownership:

**Note:** The third section discusses the social systems theory.

**Note:** Luhmann offers a mediation between the North American
School and the social constructivists. In short, and this is my
own comment, but the section begins with a description of
assumptions about scientific knowledge that seem to me to be a
very [coherentist view of epistemic justification][1]
(particularly concerning scientific knowledge). Referring to the
social systems theory as a coherentist theory means a lot to me,
so (if any public is reading this), I'll forgo noting anything
further about this now, except to say that I'm attracted to the
theory, and have written things that seem to fit very well with
it, but more commentary will take more reading.

**Note:** This is my introduction to *social systems theory* and
I'll need to come back to this piece, and look up others on the
topic, in order flesh out the specifics.
