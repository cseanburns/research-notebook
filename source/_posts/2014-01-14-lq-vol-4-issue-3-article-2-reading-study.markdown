**Note:** The second article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "A Study of the Factors
Influencing the Difficulty of Reading Materials for Adults of
Limited Reading Ability."

It was written by Edgar Dale and Ralph W. Tyler, who were
affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Bureau of Educational Research  
**Affiliation:** Ohio State University

**Note:** This should be an interesting study. It's about
identifying the characteristics of reading material that make the
material easier to comprehend for adults with limited literacy
abilities.

**Note:** The study will use multiple regression. Until now, only
correlation coefficients with confidence intervals have been used
in these early articles, so this is the most advanced use of
statistics to date in *LQ*. Note that it is written by people
outside of the library science field.

**Note:** The study, for some reason, includes only people of
color as participants. Not sure why yet. The authors do seek to
generalize to all the population and do, for the most part, seem
respectful of their participants, but some of the remarks seem to
be a bit condescending.

**Note:** The study includes only personal health reading
material.

**Note:** Very detailed description of creating and administering
the test.

**Note:** The authors are checking for reliability and validity of
their test instrument. 

**Note:** An audience statement:

> For most purposes librarians and others interested in selecting
> reading materials of given difficulty will find these three
> counts valuable (p. 402).

**Note:** The authors state their multiple regression equation and
then describe how to use it:

> The use of this regression equation may easily be shown by
> illustration. Suppose one wished to select some reading material
> which are easy enough so that they would be comprehended by at
> least 80 per cent of adults who have from third- to fifth-grade
> reading ability. Samples of these selections of similar size to
> those used in this study could be examined and the number of
> different technical words, the number of different hard,
> non-technical words, and the number of indeterminate clauses
> counted. These counts could then be multiplied by -9.4, -0.4,
> +2.2, respectively. The resulting products could then be added
> to 114.4. If all the selections were chosen in which the
> resulting sums were 80 or higher, we should have those in which
> the predicted difficulty of comprehension would be such that the
> selections would be understood by 80 per cent or more of the
> adults who have third- to fifth-grade reading ability. For these
> selections we should probably find half of them within 9 per
> cent of the difficulty predicted. Hence this regression equation
> does give a reasonably accurate prediction of the difficulty of
> reading materials similar to those used in this study (pp.
> 402-403).

**Note:** The article contains three "exhibits." Exhibits A, B,
and C are samples of the three tests administered in this study.
