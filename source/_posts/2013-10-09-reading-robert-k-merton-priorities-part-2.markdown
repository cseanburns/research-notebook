This the second part of my notes on reading "Priorities in
Scientific Discovery" in [The Sociology of Science: Theoretical
and Empirical
Investigations](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817893417) by Robert
K. Merton.

**Note:** Picking up on p. 312, section "Plagiary: fact and
slander.

**Note:** The problem, writes Merton, is not rampant steeling, but
rampant accusations of stealing.

Merton's account of the accusatory process and how it plays out is
entertaining. See, for example, page 314.

**Note:** Regarding Newton's not-so-nice attack on Leibniz over
the invention of calculus, Merton makes this point:

> It was not because Newton was so weak but because the
> institutionalized values were so strong that he was driven to
> such lengths (p. 315).

**Reflection:** I think I can buy that interpretation, but at the
same moment, I have to ask: how is it that people are prone to
institutionalizing any kind of values, whether those values are
from the institution of science or some other? I think I'm
interested in how psychology would address that question and not
just sociology?

**Note:** Actions take in order to establish priority:

1. reporting discoveries in the form of anagrams (p. 315).
2. publishing as abstracts and later as full papers (pp. 315-16)
3. "There is also the long-standing practice of depositing sealed
   and dated manuscripts with scientific academies in order to
   protect both priority and idea" (p. 316).
4. "Scientific journals often print the date on which the
   manuscript of a published article was received, thus serving
   even apart from such intent, to register the time it first came
   to notice" (p. 316).

And list goes on.

**Note:** The importance of *deviance* in Merton's thought. Just
keep that in mind, even though I don't think I've been noting it
as much as I should have in these notes. This is because, for
Merton, what highlights the norms are the deviations from the
norms. 

**Note:** Is this still true today?

> For most of us artisans of research, getting things into print
> becomes a symbolic equivalent to making a significant discovery
> (p. 316).

Ah!! Here we go:

> The indispensable reporting of research can, however, become
> converted into an itch to publish that, in turn, becomes
> aggravated by the tendency, in many academic institutions, to
> transform the sheer number of publications into a ritualized
> measure of scientific or scholarly accomplishment (p. 316).

I recall that Merton will later use the term *itch* to describe
this problem in "The Matthew Effect in Science" article.

**Note:** More on deviation:

> To this point \[...\] we have examined types of deviant
> responses to the institutional emphasis on priority that are
> *active* responses: the fabrication of "data," aggressive
> self-assertion, the denouncing of rivals, plagiary, and charges
> of plagiary. Other scientists have responded to the same
> pressures *passively* or at least by internalizing their
> aggressions and directing them against themselves (p. 317).

The point I was to make by highlight the above quote is that these
deviations (fabrication, self-assertion, etc.), for Merton,
highlight the institutional importance of priority and
originality.

**Note:** Some really interesting words on passive responses
follows that above quote--especially the notion of rejection of
the institution and self-isolation or exile.

**Note:** This is a nice conclusion to this section:

> But even though the pressures are severe, they need not produce
> much deviant behavior. There are great differences between the
> social structure of science and other social structures in which
> deviance is frequent. Among other things, the institution of
> science continues to have an abiding emphasis on other values
> that curb the culturally induced tendency toward deviation, an
> emphasis on the value of truth by whomsoever it is found, and a
> commitment to the disinterested pursuit of truth. Simply because
> we have focused on the deviant behavior of scientists, we should
> not forget how relatively rare this is. Only a few try to gain
> reputation by means that will lose them repute (p. 321).

And then a nice conclusion to the chapter, which I'll leave out
here. But it's a nice description of the institution of science.
