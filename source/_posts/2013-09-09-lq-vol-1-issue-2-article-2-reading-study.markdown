**Note:** The second article of the second issue of **The Library
Quarterly** is titled "Children and the Public Library." It was
written by Alfred S. Lewerenz, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Los Angeles City Schools

**Note:** This article takes a look at children's use of public
libraries in Los Angeles. One of the first observations: the study
is not based on a random selection of students, although the
selection of students does attempt to be methodological and
*scientific*. As a result, methodological bias is indicated or
could be suspected.

Second, while many of the previous articles I have read in this
study, with minor editing, read like they could have been written
more recently, this article strikes me as something you would
actually find in the 1930s -- esp. because of its focus on IQ.

That being said, it is interesting to read such an early study
that looks at whether there is anything distinctive about the
kinds of people who would visit the library. That is, the
fundamental questions here are: who are the people who visit the
library, are they different from the general population, and if
so, how?

That also being said, there is some confusion in the article, at
least in my of reading it. That is, this is a study of children
who are sent to public libraries by their schools. Yet the article
suggests that there is something different about these children
**a priori** instead of as a result of the schools sending
them to the public library. I am not clear on what the author is
saying here.

Note: There are a whole host of issues with the following
statement, and it is almost comical in a bad sci-fi movie kind of
way. But perhaps there is something positive in the idea that they
were aware in the 1930s that the location of the public library
was important; or, perhaps the idea that the placement of the
public library in a city is important comes from ideas about the
distribution of populations of "subnormal mentality" in a city:

> the public library may not have branches which serve sections of
> the city inhabited by a population of subnormal mentality (p.
> 157).
