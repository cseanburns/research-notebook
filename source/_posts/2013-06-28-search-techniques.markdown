Note: A few years ago (around Fall 2010, I believe), I gave a very
informal presentation to a reference class taught by [Dr. Jenny
Bossaller][1] at the University of Missouri. I had been doing some
historical research and had been talking about the process with
some of my professors, and so she asked me to come to her class
and tell them about it and about the use of print sources. Here's
a little bit of what I wrote in anticipation of that talk. I think
of this as an exercise in [search strategies][2].

I like to hear how scholars and researchers go about their daily
professional lives: how they search for information, find it,
store it, incorporate it into their own work, cite it, and so
forth. How we professionally practice in such ways seems to be
one of those things that nobody really tells you about, or that's
not always passed on from one generation to the next, especially
as new ways of doing things replace older ways. But I think these
stories reveal insights into how researchers work and so the more
we know about what others do and the more we reflect on how we
conduct this kind of work, the better, I think, we'll be able to
provide reference services.

By the way, Thomas Mann, an influential reference librarian at the
[Library of Congress][3], has written a couple of books on
researching. He likes to throw in illustrative stories about how
he's helped scholars in their work. The latest book, if you're
interested, is [The Oxford Guide to Library Research][4] (2005).

In light of this, I'm here today because I've been talking, with
my professors and fellow students, about some research I'm
conducting and the print sources I've been using to do it. The
research is on the history of library automation. Professor
Bossaller thought it would be nice if I shared the experience. I
think it's her belief that my experience isn't unique -- that many
people who do in-depth research use many sources, including print.
Perhaps you may or may not have the chance to really dig into a
research project, but if you do, or if you help others that do,
the hope is that stories like mine might be insightful.

Early in the spring semester of 2010 I was kicking around a few
ideas for a research proposal I wanted to write. On my way home
from class, I decided to head into the library, where I went to
the stacks, specifically the [Zs][5], which house books and
journals related to librarianship and information science (among
other things). While walking up and down the aisles, my eye
caught a title of a book about [Ellis Library][6], which is our
library here at MU. It was written by a former University
Librarian, [Dr. Severance][7], sometime in the 30s or 40s I
believe. When I saw that book, it clicked for me -- I'd been
tinkering with the idea of studying how academic libraries had
gone about space planning and facility improvements. Since Ellis
Library has had major renovations and additions since it opened in
1916, there I had it. Fortunately, this book mentioned some of
that work, and I was off.

I went to the OPAC and searched for more information on Ellis
Library, and specifically for anything on facility improvements,
and couldn't find anything easily. That is, nothing really jumped
out. So I went to the reference librarian and told him what I was
doing. We talked for a bit and first he sent me to special
collections and then to the University Archives. Special
collections had some documents written about Ellis Library and by
librarians who have worked there. The archives held much more.
After leaving special collections, I met with one of the
archivists and we spent about two hours discussing what was
available. I was at first interested in looking at floor plans
that might have been created throughout the last century. He gave
me a lot more.

This all took place at the beginning of that semester, so before I
left the archives I made an appointment to do more after the end
of the semester. When the semester ended, I spent the first four
weeks of the summer break, anywhere from two to four hours per
day, at the [Archives][8]. The [boxes and boxes][9] of material I
went through included pictures, letters, departmental reports,
university librarian reports to the President of the University,
past histories written on the library, circulation studies, and
more. The history of our library school is contained in these
boxes.

I tossed out the library space planning and development idea and
picked another one -- Ralph H. Parker's role in the history of
library automation. He was the Director of Libraries at Missouri
from 1947 through 1969, and the material he left behind is quite
voluminous.

But, I found a lot of great things: 

* Some photos from the 20s on bookmobiles 
* A recommendation letter written by Parker for Frederick
  Kilgour's OCLC job. 
* A letter written by Parker suggesting to someone who asked
  Parker if he knew any good *men* for a departmental head job.
  Parker replied that he didn't but he knew a good woman. I looked
  but I didn't see a reply to that letter. 

One thing that really helped me was a letter I found written by a
journal editor to Parker around 1961. The letter asked Parker for
an automation article he promised. There was nothing about this
article that I could find in the databases, but it was a clue and
it led me back to the stacks and to the journal, which we had on
the shelves. I searched through the table of contents of the
journal's issues from 1961 through 1962 and found the article.
That was a lot of fun to find it because the whole thing was based
on a little clue I happened to come across going through the
archives.

I eventually went back to the reference section. Going through
some print indexes, I was able to find more articles by Parker.
Many of these articles weren't listed in any of the online
databases, either.

Plus, I found an ALA Bulletin published in the mid 1960s with a
special issue on automation containing a bibliography of many if
not most of the articles written on the subject up to that time.
That Bulletin was probably online but finding the print version
was fortunate. It contained a massive bibliography on library
automation and many of the articles listed were in the stacks,
just yards away. This was stuff I didn't see when I was doing
online searches, and which I had thought I was doing thoroughly.

That's all I seem to have written for the talk. I did make some
revisions just now, before posting. The Parker research finally
came to a close three or so years after I started working on it.
Historical research is hard work! But it was always a side
project, too -- something I was merely curious about and
interested in doing.
