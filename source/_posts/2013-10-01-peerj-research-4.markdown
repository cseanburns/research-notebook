## Organize Data for Qualitative Analysis

Created a new project in
[RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/). Added the 203 text
files from the PeerJ sample, which includes peer reviews, editor
comments, and author rebuttals, to the RQDA project.

Used the [File
Categories](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/documentation_2.html#manual)
function in RQDA to organize the above files into three
categories:

- Peer Reviews
- Academic Editors
- Author Rebuttals

Added memos to these file categories that describe what they refer
to.

## Next Steps

1. Add a code list to RQDA, based on theoretical framework.
2. Begin coding the files.

The code list and coding will be based on the units of analysis,
which involves the Mertonian norms and the aesthetics of
scientific research.
