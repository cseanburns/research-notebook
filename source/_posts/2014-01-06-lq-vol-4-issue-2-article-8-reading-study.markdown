**Note:** The eighth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Abbreviation of Imprints."

It was written by Juul Dieserud, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Washington, D.C. (No Affiliation)

**Note:** The first sentence of this article helps put this issue
in context.

> I feel very much honored by the request to furnish a brief
> article on some library subject for the number of *Library
> quarterly* devoted to my esteemed former chief of the Catalog
> Division of the Library of Congress (p. 179).

**Note:** I like this if only because it provides some insight
into the academic background on the author (a librarian):

> In 1900 he \[J. C. M. Hanson\] recommended me for a position in
> the Library of Congress as revisor of cataloging---I am sure
> rather on the strength of personal knowledge of my philological
> degree from the University of Oslo than for the reason of my
> slight seven years' experience as a cataloger and later
> librarian of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago (p.
> 179).

**Note:** The article is, as the title suggests, about the use and
rules of abbreviations in cataloging. It is, at times, humorous.
Some remarks on enforcing a practice of collecting daily
statistics on the daily work of LC catalogers:

> From my own experience of some forty years I unhesitatingly say
> that this would spell disaster to the accuracy of the output, in
> addition to reducing the force to a nervous, irritated body of
> works with chronic dyspepsia (p. 183).
