*Goodness* made the list of items on an article titled, [Fourteen
Oddball Reasons You're Not Dead Yet][1]. Here a philosopher is
quoted:

> Then there is the whole system of medicine, both the science and
> the technology. â€¦ So I am grateful to the editorial boards and
> referees, past and present, of Science, Nature, Journal of the
> American Medical Association, Lancet, and all the other
> institutions of science and medicine that keep churning out
> improvements, detecting and correcting flaws ([Dennet,
> 11-02-2006](http://www.edge.org/conversation/thank-goodness)).

My reading of pieces like that take place amidst reading the
research on peer review. That research is all over the board. But
personally, the quote illustrates a good reason why any changes to
the peer review process should come carefully and not by some
revolution. I think this [short
article](http://altmetrics.org/altmetrics12/barr/) by Kelli Barr
is a careful depiction of that discussion.
