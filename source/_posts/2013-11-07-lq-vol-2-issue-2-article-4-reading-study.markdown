**Note:** The fourth article of the second issue of the second
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Contributions to
Egyptian Penmanship."

It was written by G. A. Crüwell, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University Library (Vienna, Austria)

**Note:** A very brief commentary on early Egyptian scribes.
Includes two plates (photos) of some early Egyptian pictographs
and hieroglyphics. 

**Note:** It is an interesting piece. I'm trying to understand the
editorial intention of a piece like this, and when [these][1]
[kinds][2] of [pieces][3] go extinct in this journal.
