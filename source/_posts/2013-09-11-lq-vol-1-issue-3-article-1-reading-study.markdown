**Note:** The first article of the third issue *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "University Libraries: Some Reflections on
the Dedication of the Sterling Memorial Library of Yale
University."

It was written by [William Warner
Bishop](http://bentley.umich.edu/research/guides/libarch/bishop.php),
who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan Library

**Note:** Interesting note about undergraduate work, from a
historical perspective:

> The age of the textbook has not passed; witness the steady
> stream issuing from the presses of the country. But the age of a
> single textbook to a course has gone. Books to be used in even
> undergraduate instruction are legion, and materials for research
> are being published in a volume unsensed by anyone who fails to
> keep close watch on the yearly output of the world's printing
> presses (p. 246).

After this study is completed, I'll have to read issues of LQ
after WWII, just to see how the sentiment and the orientation has
changed.

**Note:** On the university:

> This past century has seen also the rise of the academy from its
> early eighteenth-century state of amiable curiosity to the
> position of a powerful agency for promoting research and
> publishing its results (p. 247).

**Note:** Another, on scholarly publishing, written in 1931:

> The Surgeon-General's Library in Washington now receives 1,887
> medical journals from all over the world. Journals and yet more
> journals! No branch of science is so limited, no industry so
> small, no specialty so narrow as to have *no* periodical devoted
> to its progress. The past fifty years have seen the rise of the
> specialized periodical. Most university professors would part
> with all the monographs on their subjects rather than give up
> their files of journals. It is a day of serial publication, and
> serials are both bulky and costly--yet we must have them (pp.
> 247-248).

**Note:** Remarkable passage on page 249 that questions whether,
given all this publishing output, libraries are justified, given
their costs.

**Note:** On what is essentially a proposal for off-site
facilities for book storage and whether it would be a good idea to
have them:

> Perhaps, if communication is speeded tenfold so that readers or
> books may be hurled through the air from New Haven to Washington
> or New York in a few minutes, or if by television or some
> further wonder a book in a central storehouse may be shown
> instantly page by page in a receiving room in a library
> thousands of miles away, we shall come to the central storage
> idea (p. 250).

**Note:** Is this still true? If so, then how. If not, then what's
next?

> Starving the library hurts--not the librarian--but the scholar
> (p. 251)?

**Note:** Nice few passages about librarian education and
librarianship beginning on page 252.

In fact, library automation helped solve this problem--liberate
librarians from that drudgery:

> The pressure of work, of size, of numbers, in our university
> libraries has kept their employees so burdened with routine
> duties that in general those who have the ability have had no
> time or strength for productive work or for advancing knowledge
> (p. 253).

**Note:** This article is an amazing piece.
