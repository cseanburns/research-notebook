*Note*: Biomedical research, peer review, two functions:

> ensuring that manuscripts are improved and that only
> high-quality research is published; and ensuring that important
> findings are disseminated to other researchers and practitioners
> and, perhaps, to the general public and political bodies (pp.
> 97-98).

*Note*: Beliefs exist that peer review is necessary but is also
not successful.

*Note*: Power relations, it is argued, preserve the status quo and
lead to conservatism, such that, those with power stay in power,
and those without power must buy-in, even at the loss of
innovation.

> This study therefore aimed to use qualitative methods to
> generate a detailed understanding of the biomedical manuscript
> review process as it occurs and is described by participants. In
> particular, the goal was to inductively characterize the most
> salient social and subjective dimensions of the biomedical
> manuscript review process, and to examine biomedical editors'
> and peer reviewers' understanding and experience of these
> dimensions of the process (pp. 101-102).

*Note*: Purposive sampling. 35 open-ended interviews. 23 were
editors.

*Note*: About the interviews:

> the interviews took the form of a conversation in which emergent
> themes were clarified and followed up (p. 102).

*Note*: About the coding process:

> The method of data analysis drew on both Morse's outline of the
> cognitive basis of qualitative research (Morse 1994) and
> Charmaz's outline of data analysis in Grounded Theory (Charmaz
> 2006), and involved: initial coding using Charmaz's method of
> line-by-line analysis and "gerunding" (encoding action or
> process); synthesis of codes into categories; focused coding
> using these categories; and abstraction into concepts (Charmaz's
> "analytic categories") (pp. 102-103).

*Note*: Five broad headings were developed, related to the science
of manuscript review, the process as a "moral enterprise," the
process as it relates to "power and vulnerability," the process as
it relates to "authority and deference," and the process as it
relates to "intuition and prejudice" (p. 103).

*Note*: The impact factor as a mechanism of power relations that
cause certain actions on the part of editors.

*Note*: Interesting bit:

> To attract authors, editors of less prestigious journals spoke
> of the need to work harder to improve manuscripts since they did
> not have the liberty of using rejection of manuscripts as a
> quality control mechanism, and needed to be more careful not to
> disenfranchise potential future authors (p. 105).

Essentially, what that quote above says to me is that the quality
control mechanism of choice can certainly be presented as a
function of the number of submissions to a journal. That is, once
the rate of submissions reaches a critical point, journal editors
can employ a more selective, more conservative quality control
mechanism (i.e., rejection).

The above is an important consideration in evaluating PeerJ's
reviews. Their (stated in the FAQ, I believe) is an acceptance
rate of around 70%. Based on the above idea of quality control
mechanism as a function, PeerJ editors, we can predict, will spend
more time working with authors rather than outright rejecting
manuscripts.

For elite journals, the above process becomes more competitive but
in the tier of other elite journals.

Competition is also between editors and authors.

So, several **games** are played here:

- non-elite journals versus non-elite journals
- non-elite journals versus elite journals (by way of impact
  factor)
- editors verus authors

Relevance to PeerJ: the number of editors is vastly greater than
that of any single journal. Editorial control is distributed. This
becomes a collective action problem, in the sense that, it seems,
it will be difficult to assign editorial collective agency to
PeerJ because of this distributed editorialship.

**Note:** Another **game**:

- editors versus reviewers

*Note*: One scientist noted that it is easy to be scrutable when
editing for non-elite journals.

**Note:** Another **game**:

- editors versus "social and political systems" (p. 107).

**Note:** Important discussion about epistemic authority. The
specifics in this discussion are important, but, I think, the fact
that this is a perceived part of the role and thus has surfaced in
this study because of that, is itself important.

**Note:** There's a quote in the section, top of page 109, the
demonstrates that reviewing is a collective, social
activity---that reviewers will modify their judgments based on
what other reviewers have noted.

Thus, another **game**:

- reviewers versus reviewers.

**Note:** Another **game**, between reviewers and reviewers, but
where the editor is the so-called ringmaster, setting up the
situation so that it is a game. See top of p. 111.

Another possible **game**:

- editors versus individuals in the editorial board (see comment
  below quote).

> editors spoke of deferring to their editorial colleagues not
> just because they can provide expert advice as knowledgeable
> individuals, but also because editorial decision-making needs
> occur at the level of the collective (p. 113).

The above quote represents the dynamic between editors and the
individuals in the editorial board not so much as a game.

Thus, a collective action problem:

> "My strategy [for handling complaints]: 'It's the editors, not
> me'. We all do that. 'It's an editorial, join decision at the
> manuscript meeting'. And it is. (Penny, full-time editor) (p.
> 114).

Still, the "sheep following" (p. 114) comment represents a very
interesting collective action problem.

**Note**: Another **game**, or at least, perhaps more accurately,
a relation.

- editors versus readers

**Note**: Important and, I think, nice observation in the
discussion section:

> First, this study shows that power in manuscript review is
> conceptualized both as facilitatory ("power-to") and as
> controlling ("power-over"), and that negotiations around
> legitimate epistemic authority are at least as central to peer
> review as concerns about abuses of power (p. 116).

**Note**: If I may go back a page, there was this statement,
representing a limitation in a certain context:

> It is also notable that, while most editors interviewed were
> generally in favour of post-publication critique, only two of
> the interviewees argued for complete replacement of traditional
> pre-publication review with open publication and assessment by
> readers (a finding that could, of course, stem from the fact
> that the majority of interviewees were practicing editors) (p.
> 115).

In my research project, the reverse holds, perhaps. Since I'm
analyzing a publication platform that buys into the open
publication and assessment by readers model, in a big way.

**Note**: This observation is often, it seems to me, lost by those
arguing for open publication and assessment by readers:

> The results of this study support the idea that power is not
> simply a unidirectional and self-reinforcing phenomenon, but
> rather complex, dynamic and deeply subjective (p. 116).

That is, proponents of the *open* debate often, it seems to me,
use rhetoric that claims that their only power is to reject the
traditional model in favor of the open model, when in fact, it
seems, they do have power in the traditional model. This study,
does, support the more complicated view, although it does, at
least, have that observed limitation of being primarily a study of
editors and their viewpoints. Take this quote into consideration:

> Foucault, for example, distinguished power from domination
> (which, he argued, arises when the possibility of effective
> resistance has been removed and when it is no longer meaningful
> to speak in terms of "relations" of power) (Foucault 1980;
> Hindess 1996; Moss 1998; Mills 2003; Patton 1998) ... (p. 116).

In that light, the rhetoric of open advocates seems to be: "our
last chance before domination is to reject the traditional peer
review model."
