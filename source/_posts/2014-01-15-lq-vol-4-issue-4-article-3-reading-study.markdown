**Note:** The third article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Analytical Study of
the Use of a College Library."

It was written by H. V. Gaskill, R. M. Dunbar, and C. H. Brown,
who were affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Iowa State College Library

**Note:** Although this article is about library use, some of the
questions the authors raise in the first paragraph border on
information behavior questions.

**Note:** This is a very thorough piece. Mentions the need for
a qualitative study and I haven't seen that term used before in
these early issues.

**Note:** Data collection and research questions:

> Three methods were used for the collection of data: (1) count
> and analysis of attendance, (2) personal interviews, (3) count
> and analysis of slips for books charged over the assigned
> reading desk. An attempt was made to answer four questions: How
> many students use the library? For what purpose do students come
> to the library? Why do students fail to get what they want? What
> is the nature of the use of reserved books?

The authors pretested their interview questions.

**Note:** Important passage about information desires and
librarians:

> Five or six of the students who failed to obtain the material
> desired were not very complimentary to the library in their
> expressions of dissatisfaction. Students, like most of the rest
> of us, "want what they want when they want it." One observant
> student complained that "the perpetual costume of a librarian
> seems to be a frown" (p. 582).

**Note:** The daily use number, given the student enrollment, is a
bit high.

> The mean daily use of the library at Iowa State College was
> 4,200 volumes. The student enrollment was 3,384.
