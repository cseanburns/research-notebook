**Note:** The fifth article of the fourth issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "The Compilation of
Union Lists of Serial Publications According to the "H.C.F." of
Titles."

It was written P. Freer, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of the Witwatersrand

**Note:** Technical article on cataloging union lists of
periodicals. This is proto stuff --- signifies some of the
complicated problems that librarians were dealing with as
scientific communication really began to take off. Nice example of
the problem:

> Incidentally, the arrangement here suggested will meet, perhaps
> better than any other, Mr. Smith's requirements of a union list,
> where he says: "The purpose of a Union List of periodicals is to
> enable a researcher to discover where he may consult a given
> periodical, from a reference which is generally not completely
> accurate, is frequently abbreviated, and is sometimes truncated
> to the point of lunacy" (p. 621).

**Note:** There's a good point on the importance of typesetting
the list of periodicals so that the list is readable. We might
call this a usability issue now.

**Note:** I have no idea what "H.C.F." means. Aside from looking
up some references the author points to, the main clue is this:

> By that I mean that the all-important arranging word---the
> "H.C.F."---occurs as part of their titles" (p. 611).
