**Note:** The sixth article of the third issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Bibliographical Work
in Russia."

It was written by Dimitry M. Krassovsky, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Hoover War Library, Stanford University

**Note:** It is interesting to read a library science article
about the USSR and that predates the Cold War.

**Reflection:** Mental note: Incorporate bibliographical and
bio-bibliographical work.

**Note:** Nice turn a phrase the captures what a library is
without people to use it:

> The revolution gave impetus to the development of libraries, and
> the introduction of technical facilities made of them not
> "cemeteries of books" but living bodies (p. 461).

In essence, library science is the study of library as a living
body -- of its health, its use, its betterment, etc.

**Note:** Interesting history of library science developments in
post-revolutionary Russia.
