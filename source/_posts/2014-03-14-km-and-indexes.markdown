**Preface:**

This semester I am teaching a knowledge management (KM) course. I
will be posting entries throughout the semester that describe,
critique, summarize, outline, etc. KM articles that my students
are not reading. The purpose here is to leverage the amount of
material I can expose them to.

**Article under discussion:**

This post is about:

Zedelmaier, Helmut. (2007). Facilitas inveniendi: The alphabetical
index as a knowledge management tool. *The Indexer, 25*(4),
235-242.

**Notes and discussion:**

Last week I outlined an article that covered [ethical research
topics within knowledge
management](/blog/2014/03/07/knowledge-management-and-ethics/).
Given the ethical perspective and the argument in that article, I
think it makes sense to step outside the main channels of KM
literature and cover a KM topic with a historical perspective.

The article (reference above) discusses the history of various
knowledge management tools, including encyclopedias, indexes, and
like.

Helmut begins by bridging historical studies of pre-modern
encyclopedias (and other forms of compendiums) to current
knowledge management studies.

He then highlights the importance of the index as a tool 

> used to ensure the effective and rapid retrieval of information
> from the often enormous apparatus of knowledge (p. 235).

And outlines several criteria of encyclopedias. Specifically, they

> must be accessible, allow rapid familiarization with a
> particular (or the entire) domain of knowledge, and be arranged
> in such a way that the knowledge they contain is quickly
> retrievable (p. 235).

Some key ideas with some modern equivalents I've added:

* Encyclopedias were once used as a kind of handbook, containing
  how-tos and instructions rather than just topical articles.
  Today we might think of
  [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page) as the
  modern equivalent and the current companion to
  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) as scholars
  thought of encyclopedias in times past.
* In terms of an "instruction manual", the encyclopedia has roots
  in bibliography, such that modern equivalents might be
  applications such as [CiteULike](https://www.citeulike.org),
  [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org),
  [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com), and others.
* Note-taking and compiling were important knowledge creation
  functions. Modern equivalents might include such things as
  [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) and other [notetaking
  software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notetaking_software).
  Perhaps also applications such as
  [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/).
* Various forms of indexing. Think of modern equivalents: [Subject
  indexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_indexing), [Web
  indexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_indexing),
  [Bibliographic
  indexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibliographic_index).

I'm reading into this, but you can see an important conceptual
relation between indexes and hyper-links:

> Indexes, Gessner claims (1548: Fol. 20v), should not give folio
> or page numbers, but should rather refer to chapter and
> paragraph numbers in order to provide a standardized network of
> references, valid irrespective of edition (p. 237).

Hyper-links, for example, have the capability to refer to specific
pages but also to parts of a page. This is a powerful way to
interact with text, documentation, or recorded knowledge more
generally.

There is also a relation between indexes and read behavior. For
example, indexes allow for a systematic ability to approach a text
non-linearly. That is, an index allows readers to skip about a
work rather than read it from beginning to end.

> the new printing technique only refined methods of textual
> organization which had led to a liberation from purely linear
> ways of reading and had already been in widespread use in
> universities for over 300 years before the printing press
> appeared (p. 237).

Are alphabetically sorted indexes "unscholarly"? Is there a
relationship between the unscholariness of an index to its ease of
use?

> Albertus Magnus, for example, saw alphabetical arrangement as a
> **modus non philosophicus**, it it breaks up the coherence of
> knowledge. Yet he also said that the use of alphabetical order
> leads to **ad facilitatem doctrinae**, and is therefore in the
> interest of the user (p. 239).

Indexes are a powerful form of organizing knowledge. When
codifying a domain of knowledge, it's important to consider how
the parts of the codification are referenced as well as how the
references themselves are organized. 

The ability to retrieve information or knowledge has an impact on
the tacit / explicit knowledge distinction. Think of, for example,
the [high velocity / turbulent
(HVT)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/13673271211262808) article. Part
of the reason tacit knowledge is so well valued in such HVT
environments is because information / knowledge storage and
retrieval of codified knowledge is much slower than the brain. In
such scenarios, training, preparation, and experience (the
development of tacit knowledge) are more helpful for
decision-making.
