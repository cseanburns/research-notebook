**Note:** The third article of the fourth issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled " Report of Bureau of Standards Research on
Preservation of Records."

It was written by B. W. Scribner, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Washington, D.C.

**Note:** The article begins by describing the concern about
preserving records due to paper quality, which became a concern
around the early to later part of the 19th century.

**Note:** What's interesting, as a side note, is that the author's
description of the problem is insightful and almost mathematical.
Or maybe it's just my reading of it. Anyhow, the author's
description can be stated more generally. Caveat: this is not what
the author writes or claims; rather, it's the generalization of
it, and it's not something I claim to be true--just
thought-framing.

- advancing education causes cheaper communication
- quality of information storage is a function of the
  dissemination of information

**Reflection:** There's not much more I want to write about this
article. I think it will stick with me and I can see myself
drawing from it for some future project. Otherwise, it's an
interesting piece that reports findings on research that causes
paper to deteriorate--at a time when this was very new information
/ findings. For example:

- "effect of light"
- "Drying-out effect"
- "Effect of sulphur dioxide" (acidity) (pp. 415-416).

It's also interesting because it highlights how the research in
this area (paper quality and its standardization) marks some of
the earliest, modern discussions on *information storage.*
