I recently started reading Ronald Day's *The Modern Invention of
Information: Discourse, History, and Power*. I'm putting aside for
a moment some of the interesting critiques Day has regarding Briet
and Latour in order to note something he says about Briet's work
and to connect that with [Merton's
norms](/blog/2013/09/19/reading-robert-k-merton-normative-structure/).

It seems likely that to satisfy payment in the form of esteem and
recognition (see Merton on the norm of *communism*), the
dissemination of the scholarly record functioned as a reinforcing
mechanism for these norms.

Another note:

Unlike documentation, some strains in information science believe
that filtering is a way of "managing this crisis." For example,
through algorithms or social networks. This is a direct move away
the practice of documentation and library science, and should be
seen as such.
