**Note:** The fifth article of the first issue of the third volume
of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Student use of the library."

It was written by Alvin C. Eurich, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Minnesota

**Note:** A nice early study of library use. Most students, for
example, during the study period checked out books in the
following areas: literature (primarily English / British),
history, education, economics, philosophy, and sociology. Etc.
There is some disagreement between the surrounding text and the
accompanying figure on page 88. In the surrounding text, the
author refers to the fourth ranking item as philosophy but in the
accompanying chart, it's referred to as philology and it's ranked
fifth. This is because the paragraph doesn't include Education,
which in the chart is ranked third. This is all from the general
circulation.

**Note:** The author then describes the use and circulation of
reserve books. The question the author is interested in, partly at
least, is whether the books on reserve are serving their purpose.
Seems so:

> In other words, the circulation of books follows closely the
> number of books in each field that are placed on reserver (p.
> 92).

**Note:** Next periodicals. Whoops:

> A misunderstanding caused the call-slips to be destroyed for the
> first day of the period of observation (p. 92).

**Note:** On to student use of the library by ratio. The author
goes to lengths to stress the difference between the ratio and the
proportion of use.

**Note:** This is an extremely interesting comment that just comes
kind of as an accident but is revealing of the times and the
university movement in general:

> If the new freedom that college students are being given is to
> develop greater initiative in the realm of scholarship, an
> increased use of the library should become evident (p. 94).
