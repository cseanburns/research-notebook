Some additional notes on Farkas-Conn's [From Documentation to
Information Science](http://www.asis.org/Farkas-Conn-FDTIS.html):

Farkas-Conn makes a couple important references to early
automation efforts at the Boston Public Library and the Library of
Congress. She writes that:

> In the 1930s a few libraries had automated some of their
> information work. The Boston Public Library used punched cards
> for analyzing acquisitions in 1934. Later, the Library of
> Congress had its personnel records on punched cards; by sorting
> cards mechanically, lists could be prepared on short notice of
> staff members serving in the National Guard or eligible for
> draft (p. 132).

The endnote for the above paragraph indicates that the material is
based on an interview the author had with [Luther H.
Evans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_H._Evans). It is
unfortunate that someone at the Boston Public Library or the
Library of Congress didn't publish something about these
experiences at the time. (I don't think there's a record of such a
publication. I could have missed something, but I did a pretty
comprehensive search a while back -- in both the early print
indexes as well as online.) If they had, it might have inspired
others to imitate their work, just as it inspired Frederick
Kilgour to pick up on Ralph Parker's ([Kilgour,
1987](http://www.citeulike.org/user/seancsb/article/7943616))

I am taking this out of context, but it's a quote worth
remembering -- both because it illustrates how young the field is,
in its modern form:

> Substantive research in librarianship had only begun two decades
> earlier with the foundation of the Graduate Library School at
> the University of Chicago (p. 136).

And there is a endnote for that sentence that points to:

W. Boyd Rayward, "Librarianship and Information Research; Together
or Apart?" in *The Study of Information*, ed. Machlap and
Mansfield, 350-51 (see n. 1).

The philosophical difference between Mortimer Taube and Calvin
Mooers approaches to information retrieval seems to be incredibly
important for understanding the history of information science.
See pages 139-140.

This is an important note about library education in the 1950s
(before graduate school in library science was common, by the
way):

> No formal training in documentation was being offered in the
> United States. English documentalists visiting the country in
> 1950, were surprised that library school curricula were limited
> to historical matters and the mechanics of library techniques
> with little or no attention being given "to study the process of
> disseminating information with a view to improving the
> prevailing arrangements" (p. 145).

The source cited is:

D. J. Urquhart, "American Impressions," *American Documentation* 2
(Spring 1951):100-102.

--

The section **A Journal For Documentation** that begins on p. 172
provides a number of points about journals (at least with respect
to *American Documentation*) that are important about the
scientific culture and the beginnings of a new field of inquiry.

I imagine, and for good reasons, that Birger HjÃ¶rland would have
been sympathetic to what D. J. Urquhart found in his mid-twentieth
century visit to the U.S., regarding the classification issue:

> He [Urquhart] was surprised that Americans were not familiar
> with some recent European developments in microfilm technology
> and that they were not interested in classification, which
> usually evoked intense discussions among European
> documentalists. Implied in Urquhart's report is the question
> whether Americans, in the midst of large-scale operations, were
> giving sufficient consideration to the basic philosophy of
> documentation issues, a question raised by Europeans in other
> meetings (p. 174).

I think librarians get it now (or hope so):

> No formal organization existed in the postwar era for
> individuals responsible for information center operations or for
> those interested in information work. ALA and SLA did not
> provide suitable forums because the majority of librarians did
> not comprehend, or did not want to acknowledge, that the new
> challenges the major information centers had to face called for
> unorthodox solutions (p. 144).

For anyone interested in library automation, information
retrieval, etc., then chapter 7, ["New Winds
Blowing](http://adi-asist.accessinn.com/2012/03/7-new-winds-blowing/),"
seems to me to be an essential read, for at the very least,
historical purposes.
