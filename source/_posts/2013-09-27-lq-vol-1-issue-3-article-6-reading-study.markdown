**Note:** The sixth article of the third issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "The Public Library under the City-Manager
Form of Government (Continued)."

It was written by Carleton B. Joeckel, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** University of Michigan

**Note:** The first part of this article was published in the
second issue of this volume. My notes on that article are here:

[Joeckel1931a](/blog/2013/08/28/lq-vol-1-issue-2-article-1-reading-study/)

**Note:** Joeckel begins to write more in depth about the various
sorts of public library governance. The article has the following
sections:

- "CORPORATE LIBRARIES UNDER SELF-PERPETUATING BOARDS" (p. 301).
- "LIBRARIES CONTROLLED BY ASSOCIATIONS AND CLUBS" (p. 302).
- "MUNICIPAL PUBLIC LIBRARIES UNDER CONTROL OF THE CITY MANAGER" (p. 304).

**Note** About corporate (public) libraries. Legally, they are
corporations. In practice, they are not much different than
libraries governed by city councils:

> The important point, of course, is that the governing boards of
> these libraries are created by special state statutes and that
> their members appoint their own successors. They are thus
> completely independent, legally, of the municipal government and
> are responsible only to themselves for their own acts. However,
> this separateness is somewhat fictitious, since the city council
> has the power of the purse and can alter its appropriations to
> the library as it sees fit (p. 301).

**Note:** About libraries controlled by associations and clubs.
This form of management had been common. The two libraries under
investigation here are the Portsmouth Public Library, which

> is controlled by the Ladies' Library Association of that city,
> which elects a board of twelve members to manage the library.
> Even here, however, there is a certain amount of supervision by
> the director of public welfare, who is a city official; and the
> annual report of the library is forwarded to the city manager
> and city council (p. 303).

And the Flagler Memorial Library of Miami in Miami, Florida. This
is an interesting set up:

> The Flagler Memorial Library of Miami seems almost to defy
> classification. It has been placed in this group, because it is
> actually managed by the Miami Woman's Club through its library
> committee. This unusual arrangement is due to the fact that
> Henry Flagler originally donated to the Woman's Club a piece of
> ground, stipulating that the club should maintain a free
> reading-room. For over twenty-five years the library thus
> established served as the only public library of Miami, a
> membership fee of $1.00 a year being charged. It has received
> financial support from the city only since 1924, at which time
> it assumed the functions of a free public library. Curiously
> enough, the present annual appropriation of $30,000 is paid from
> the publicity fund of the city (p. 303).

**Note:** About public libraries controlled by the city manager:

Interesting tidbit about "newest type of municipal executive":

> We now turn to a group of cities in which this tradition of
> independence has been broken down, in which the newest type of
> municipal executive, the city manager, has been definitely given
> authority over the destinies of the public library (p. 304).

**Note:** Joeckel divides this group into two subgroups:

- "those in which the library is merely a municipal department
  headed by a single executive, the librarian, who is directly
  under the city manager;"
- "second, those libraries in which the library board has been
  retained as an intermediate authority between the manager and
  the librarian" (p. 305).

**Note:** There's a lot of detail in the following pages, and it's
not important for me (for this project) to note it all, but the
details reveal a fascinating history of early 20th century public
libraries.

However, one of the important points to be made is that libraries
(at this time) that did not have boards but that operated under a
city-manager seemed sometimes to be highly dependent on the
city-manager's level of attention on the library. That is, this
form of governance seems to result in an unpredictable situation
for the library as it not only depends on whether the city manager
cares but also on whether the city manager is involved. Ah, so
Joeckel says as much here:

> The whole matter may well be summed up by saying the success of
> the library under the direct supervision of the manager depends
> very largely on the attitude of the individual manager toward
> the library. Librarians working under managers are practically a
> unit on this point, regardless of whether their personal
> experience has been favorable or unfavorable. If the manager
> believes thoroughly in the importance of libraries, he usually
> has it in his power to see that the library in his city receives
> adequate support and is efficiently administered. If he is
> indifferent, or worse, there is little hope for progress in
> library service (p. 313).

**Note:** This could be used to explain or as an example of why a
profession is important for the administration of libraries:
Joeckel notes that many of the problems with the city manager set
up is that many of the city managers (at least at the time) were
engineers, who, the author argues, may be more interested in their
own projects than they are in libraries. See top of p. 314.

**Note:** Interesting note, hypothetical back and forth, between
what a city manager would want and what a librarian would want in
the form of oversight. See pp. 319-320.

**Note:** This is good. He lists the "principal arguments in favor
of separate library organization" beginning on page 321. They are:

1. They have been successful, historical.
2. Library boards are made up by those in the community. Nice
   quote: "The great value of the board is not that it will
   actually devise ways and means for administering the
   library--that a wise board leaves to the librarian it
   appoints--but rather that it is able to interpret the community
   and its needs and ..." (p. 322). Also: "Or, as stated by
   another librarian, 'a board is needed to interpret the library
   to the community and the community to the library'" (pp.
   322-3).
3. "Continuity of policy" (p. 323). And: "Continuity in policy
   *is* important for a library, for it can ill adapt itself to
   violent and sudden changes in income, in management, or in
   service" (p. 323).
4. "Separate library administration will probably permit the
   library to be considered a part of the educational system of
   the community, which is not likely to be the case when it is
   entirely absorbed into the general municipal organization" (p.
   324).
5. Regarding the profession: "the library staff is more likely to
   receive the special professional treatment which it requires
   under separate control than as a part of the general municipal
   personnel" (p. 324).

**Note:** Joeckel then provides the arguments that have favored a
city manager administration. I won't list them, but they're
interesting.

However, there are some important remarks on taxation -- including
whether there should be a separate library tax or whether funds
for libraries should come out of a single tax.

**Note:** I really enjoy reading Carleton Joeckel. This is a nice
final line:

> The age of experiment is not over in American municipal
> government, and we are certainly not yet ready to abandon
> completely the idea of the independence of the public library
> (p. 329).
