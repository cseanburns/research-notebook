**Note:** The fifth article of the fourth issue of *The Library
Quarterly* is titled "Classification and Cataloguing in the
Scandinavian Countries"

It was written by Claude H. Christensen, who was affiliated with:

**Affiliation:** Graduate Library School, University of Chicago

**Note:** Begins with praise of the order in Scandinavian
libraries and proceeds to discuss their history.

**Note:** There is one theme that I seem to find across many
different types of library histories. The problems that have
plagued libraries, especially around the middle to later part of
the 19th century, is this: library methods could not scale with
increased communication. In order to meet that challenges, they
discarded, revised, and invented new methods to scale up. In this
article's context:

> The works of Francke, Ebert, Schrettinger, and others excited a
> renewed interest in library methods, which were proving quite
> inadequate for the proper handling of the growing collections
> (p. 440).

**Reflection:** I enjoy reading articles about the development of
classification systems, and this article is partly about that.
Articles like these remind me how historically situated and
culturally defined classification systems are.

**Note:** We may not have *rulers* anymore, but we still have this
problem and this outcome:

> During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the fortunes of
> the library depended largely upon the attitude of the rulers,
> and at times there was little or no progress (p. 451).
