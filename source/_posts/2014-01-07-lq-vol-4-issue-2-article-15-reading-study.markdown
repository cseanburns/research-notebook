**Note:** The fifteenth article of the second issue of the fourth
volume of *The Library Quarterly* is titled "Ernesto and Eugenio
do Canto: A Contribution of Azorean Bio-Bibliography."

It was written by Walther F. Koenig, who was affiliated
with:

**Affiliation:** Oldenburg, Germany (No affiliation)

**Note:** This is, as the title suggests, both a biography and a
bibliography. Not sure why it's printed in this issue that is,
essentially, a dedication to Jameson. I may not have stated this
explicitly before, but there is no editorial introduction to this
issue (or to any of the other issues in the volumes under study).

That aside, I like the idea of a bio-bibliography.
