Polanyi, Michael. (2009). *The tacit dimension*. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press. (Original work published 1966) URL:

There are many ways to read Polanyi (2009), and the knowledge
management literature has taken off with the very singular aspect
of his work -- that "we can know more than what we can tell" (p.
4) (as well as Nonaka's version of tacit knowledge), but the idea
has a really important implication for the nature and work of
science, and Polanyi discusses this in some detail in the third
chapter.

We can relate the implication to some modern developments. There
is a growing number of researchers who are actively pushing for a
thing called *open science*. Some of the arguments put forth in
favor of a process that opens science include claims that an open
science will result in a more efficient system that takes
advantage of web and Internet technologies, is able to operate
with better transparency, is better at re-using other scientists'
data, and is better at attributing other scientists' work. In some
ways, we might say that an open science is the full, or nearly
full, realization of the [inherent norms of scientific
practice][1]. 

Aside from that, there is also in the rhetoric among proponents of
open science the idea that an open science results in a science
that is more scientific. The key idea here is that science
practiced openly will be more available for critique, review,
judgment, and so forth and as such, its epistemological claims can
more easily be [falsified][2] or [verified][3]. Thus, and at the
very least, there are ideas inherent in the open science movement
that imply that science is not science unless it is open.

So one basic issue here is the [criterion of demarcation][4]. That
is, what criterion can we use to identify science from what is not
science (or pseudoscience)? This is an important epistemological
issue for Polanyi --- if "we can know more than we can tell" means
we can only communicate so much of what we know, and science (esp.
open science) is about being better at communicating scientific
work, then even under a better model of scholarly and scientific
communication, there will always be an upper bound limit on what
can be falsified or verified. That means, there will never be a
complete guarantee that scientific claims can be trusted.

But what is also not fully acknowledged are other ideas about the
demarcation of science --- issues related to problem-solving (ala
[Kuhn][5]) and problem-finding (ala [Merton][6]). Here we can
refer to, I think, one of the best passages (pp. 64-66) of
Polanyi's book, the ending of which he writes:

> Thus the scientific interest--or scientific value--of a
> contribution is formed by three factors: its **exactitude**, its
> **systematic importance**, and the **intrinsic interest of its
> subject matter** (p. 66).

In other words, Polanyi argues that we can demarcate science not
just by its truthfulness, its coherence, but also by whether it's
**interesting** in the right **theoretical** way.

[#kmcci][7], I added a work-in-progress manuscript to Bb. The
abstract is [here][8], but go to the Course Content page on Bb for
the most recent version of it. The manuscript, if you're
interested, more fully expands on some of these ideas.
