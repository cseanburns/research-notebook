### Part 1: Polanyi and the Epistemology of Science

There are a number of ways to read Polanyi (2009), and the knowledge
management literature has taken off with the very singular aspect of his
work -- that "we can know more than what we can tell" (p. 4) (as well as
[Nonaka's][1a] version of tacit knowledge), and much of the focus has been
on business and organizational management. However, Polanyi's idea has an
important implication for the nature and work of science, with implications
for science policy, and Polanyi discusses this in some detail in the third
chapter.

We can relate the implication to some modern developments. There is a
growing number of researchers who are actively pursuing a thing called [open
science][1b]. Some of the arguments put forth in favor of a process that
*opens* science include claims that an open science will result in a more
efficient system that takes advantage of web and Internet technologies, is
able to operate with better transparency, is better at re-using other
scientists' data, and is better at attributing other scientists' work (e.g.,
see [Woelfle, Olliaro, and Todd, 2011][1c]). In some ways, we might say that
an open science is the full, or nearly full, realization of the [inherent
norms of scientific practice][1].

In this rhetoric among the proponents of open science lies the idea that an
open science results in a science that is more scientific. The key idea here
is that science practiced openly will be more available for critique,
review, judgment, and so forth and as such, its epistemological claims can
more easily be [falsified][2] or [verified][3] via, usually,
[reproducibility][3a] (or more appropriately, a test of commensurability
rather than a test of verification). Thus, and at the very least, there are
ideas inherent in the open science movement that imply that science is not
science unless it is open and it is not true unless it is reproducible, in a
very mechanical sense.

As a result of these claims, the suggested move forward in *open science* is
to test whether an open science results in a better quality science (e.g.,
does data sharing lead to better scientific outcomes, etc.). But this
largely ignores some of the epistemological problems with
[commensurability][3b]. Furthermore, and pertinent to this, is one basic
issue: the [criterion of demarcation][4]. That is, what criterion can we use
to identify science from what is not science (or pseudoscience)? This is an
important epistemological issue for Polanyi --- if "we can know more than we
can tell" means we can communicate only so much of what we know, and open
science is about being better at communicating scientific work, then even
under a better model of scholarly and scientific communication there will
always be an upper bound limit on what can be falsified or commensurated.
This means there will never be a complete guarantee that scientific claims
can be trusted.

What is also not fully acknowledged are other ideas about the demarcation of
science --- issues related to problem-solving (ala [Kuhn][5]) and
problem-finding (ala [Merton][6]). Here we can refer to, I think, one of the
best passages (pp. 64-66) of Polanyi's book, the ending of which he writes:

> Thus the scientific interest--or scientific value--of a contribution is
> formed by three factors: its **exactitude**, its **systematic
> importance**, and the **intrinsic interest of its subject matter** (p.
> 66).

In other words, Polanyi argues that we can demarcate science not
just by its truthfulness, its coherence, but also by whether it's
**interesting** in the right **theoretical** way.

In later posts, I'll write more about the commensurability issue -- as it
relates to Polanyi's description of tacit knowledge.
